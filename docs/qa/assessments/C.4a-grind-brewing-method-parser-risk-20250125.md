# Risk Profile: Story C.4a

Date: 2025-01-25
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 2
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 90/100 (low risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

**None identified** - The implementation is low-risk with only minor test issues.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 0 risks
- Performance: 0 risks  
- Data: 0 risks
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 1 risk (test failures)

### By Component

- Grind Parser: 0 risks
- ArtifactMapper Integration: 0 risks
- Default Grind Logic: 0 risks
- Pipeline Integration: 1 risk (test coverage)

## Detailed Risk Register

### TEST-001: Integration Test Failures (Medium Risk)

**Risk**: Integration test failures in batch performance and source detection
**Impact**: Medium - May indicate pattern matching gaps in production scenarios
**Probability**: Medium - Test failures suggest real issues
**Mitigation**: Fix pattern matching gaps and source detection logic
**Owner**: dev
**Timeline**: Before production deployment

### TEST-002: Pattern Matching Coverage (Low Risk)

**Risk**: Batch performance test expects 8 grind types but only detects 6
**Impact**: Low - May miss some grind types in edge cases
**Probability**: Low - Only affects specific test scenarios
**Mitigation**: Review and expand pattern matching for missing grind types
**Owner**: dev
**Timeline**: Future improvement

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**Not applicable** - No critical risks identified.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**Not applicable** - No high risks identified.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Unit Tests**: 24 tests covering all grind types and edge cases
- **ArtifactMapper Tests**: 7 tests covering RPC integration
- **Default Grind Tests**: 11 tests covering heuristics and logic
- **Pipeline Tests**: 8 tests covering full integration
- **Integration Tests**: 8/10 passing (2 failures need attention)

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- Fix integration test failures (TEST-001)
- Verify pattern matching coverage for all expected grind types

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Minor pattern matching gaps (TEST-002) can be addressed in future iterations

### Accepted Risks

**None** - All identified risks should be addressed.

## Monitoring Requirements

**Minimal monitoring required** due to low-risk nature:

- **Test Coverage**: Monitor integration test pass rates
- **Pattern Matching**: Track grind type detection accuracy
- **Performance**: Batch processing efficiency metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New grind types need to be added
- Pattern matching accuracy issues reported
- Integration test failures increase
- Performance degradation observed

## Key Principles Applied

- **Risk-First Approach**: Comprehensive analysis of all potential risk areas
- **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Based on actual implementation and test results
- **Pragmatic Balance**: Focus on real risks rather than theoretical concerns
- **Production Readiness**: Assessment aligned with production deployment requirements
