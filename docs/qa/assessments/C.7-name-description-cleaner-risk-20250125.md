## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | Text Processing Complexity | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| PERF-001 | Batch Processing Performance | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |
| DATA-001 | Text Data Loss          | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |
| SEC-001  | HTML Injection Prevention | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests

- Test complex HTML structures and Unicode characters
- Verify confidence scoring accuracy
- Test edge cases with malformed HTML

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests

- Performance tests for large batch processing
- Data integrity tests for text preservation
- Security tests for HTML sanitization

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- No critical risks identified

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- All identified risks have appropriate mitigations
- Confidence scoring system provides quality assurance
- Comprehensive error handling prevents data loss

### Accepted Risks

- All risks are acceptable with implemented mitigations

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Text processing confidence scores
- Batch processing performance metrics
- Error rates in text cleaning operations
- Data quality metrics for cleaned text

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New text processing requirements added
- Performance issues reported in production
- Data quality issues identified
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in HTML processing
