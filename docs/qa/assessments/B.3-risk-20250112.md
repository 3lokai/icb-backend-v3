## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | Monitoring service dependency failure | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified - all risks are manageable with proper implementation.

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### TECH-001: Monitoring Service Dependency Failure

**Score: 4 (Medium Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium - External service dependencies
**Impact**: Medium - Monitoring capabilities reduced

**Mitigation**:
- Implement graceful degradation when monitoring services unavailable
- Add fallback logging mechanisms for critical metrics
- Design circuit breaker pattern for external service calls
- Implement health checks for monitoring services

**Testing Focus**: Test monitoring service failure scenarios and graceful degradation

### TECH-002: Rate Limit Backoff Configuration Tuning

**Score: 2 (Low Risk)**
**Probability**: Medium - Configuration requires tuning
**Impact**: Low - Performance optimization needed

**Mitigation**:
- Start with conservative backoff parameters
- Implement configuration monitoring and alerting
- Add A/B testing capabilities for backoff parameters
- Document tuning guidelines for production

**Testing Focus**: Test various backoff scenarios and performance impact

### OPS-001: Alert Fatigue from Threshold Misconfiguration

**Score: 2 (Low Risk)**
**Probability**: Low - Proper configuration management
**Impact**: Medium - Reduced alert effectiveness

**Mitigation**:
- Implement alert throttling and deduplication
- Add alert severity levels and escalation paths
- Create alert configuration validation
- Monitor alert frequency and effectiveness

**Testing Focus**: Test alert throttling and threshold validation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests

- Monitoring service failure scenarios
- Rate limit backoff with various failure patterns
- Alert throttling and deduplication

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests

- Configuration validation and tuning
- Performance impact of monitoring overhead
- Alert delivery and formatting

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All medium risks must have mitigation strategies implemented
- Monitoring service failure handling must be tested
- Alert throttling must be functional

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Low risks can be addressed post-deployment
- Configuration tuning can be iterative

### Accepted Risks

- Some performance overhead from monitoring (acceptable trade-off)
- External service dependencies (managed with circuit breakers)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Monitoring service health and availability
- Rate limit backoff effectiveness
- Alert frequency and response times
- Performance impact of monitoring overhead

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Monitoring service providers change
- Rate limiting patterns change significantly
- Alert thresholds need adjustment
- Performance requirements change

## Key Principles

- Identify risks early and systematically
- Use consistent probability Ã— impact scoring
- Provide actionable mitigation strategies
- Link risks to specific test requirements
- Track residual risk after mitigation
- Update risk profile as story evolves
