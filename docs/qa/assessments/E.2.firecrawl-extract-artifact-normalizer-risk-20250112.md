## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- **Technical**: 2 risks (1 medium, 1 low)
- **Maintainability**: 1 risk (1 medium)
- **Performance**: 0 risks
- **Security**: 0 risks
- **Operational**: 0 risks

### By Component

- **Code Quality**: 2 risks
- **Testing**: 1 risk
- **Integration**: 0 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Code Quality Issues (Medium Risk)

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: High - Linting violations are present
**Impact**: Medium - Impacts maintainability and team standards

**Description**: Multiple linting violations including unused imports, whitespace issues, and unused variables in the main service file.

**Mitigation**:
- Run flake8 linter and fix all violations
- Remove unused imports: `asyncio`, `Tuple`, `FirecrawlBudgetExceededError`, `PipelineConfig`
- Fix whitespace issues throughout the file
- Remove unused variable `test_result` in health_check method

**Testing Focus**: Verify code quality improvements don't break functionality

### MNT-001: Maintainability Concerns (Medium Risk)

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Code quality issues accumulate over time
**Impact**: Medium - Makes code harder to maintain and debug

**Description**: Code quality violations impact long-term maintainability and team development velocity.

**Mitigation**:
- Establish code quality gates in CI/CD pipeline
- Add pre-commit hooks for linting
- Regular code quality reviews

**Testing Focus**: Ensure maintainability improvements don't introduce regressions

### TEST-001: Integration Test Warnings (Low Risk)

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: High - Warnings appear on every test run
**Impact**: Low - Cosmetic issue, doesn't affect functionality

**Description**: Integration test markers not registered in pytest configuration, causing warnings.

**Mitigation**:
- Add `@pytest.mark.integration` to pytest configuration
- Register custom markers in pyproject.toml

**Testing Focus**: Verify test markers work correctly

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Code Quality Tests

- Run linting tests to verify all violations are fixed
- Regression tests to ensure functionality is preserved
- Code review to verify improvements

### Priority 2: Integration Tests

- Verify integration test markers work correctly
- Ensure test warnings are eliminated

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All linting violations must be resolved
- Code quality standards must be met

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Integration test warnings can be addressed in next iteration
- Performance optimizations can be added later

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Code quality metrics in CI/CD pipeline
- Test execution time and reliability
- Integration test performance

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New linting violations are introduced
- Code quality standards change
- Integration test framework is updated
