- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 85/100 (calculated)

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Code Quality: 3 risks (0 critical)
- Security: 0 risks
- Performance: 0 risks
- Reliability: 0 risks
- Operational: 0 risks

### By Component

- Alert Service: 2 risks
- Threshold Monitoring: 1 risk
- Integration: 0 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| CODE-001 | Linting violations impact maintainability | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium |
| CODE-002 | Whitespace issues reduce code readability | Medium (2) | Low (1) | 2 | Low |
| CODE-003 | Line length violations affect code standards | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Low |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Code Quality Tests

- Linting validation tests
- Code formatting verification
- Import dependency checks

### Priority 2: Functional Tests

- Alert service functionality
- Threshold monitoring accuracy
- Integration with Sentry and Slack

### Priority 3: Performance Tests

- Alert processing performance
- Threshold calculation efficiency
- Memory usage monitoring

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical and high-severity linting violations
- Unused import cleanup
- Line length compliance

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium-severity whitespace issues (with automated formatting)
- Low-severity formatting issues (with monitoring)

### Accepted Risks

- None - all risks are addressable through code cleanup

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Code quality metrics in CI pipeline
- Linting violation trends
- Code maintainability scores

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New linting violations are introduced
- Code formatting standards change
- Maintainability requirements evolve
- Development team composition changes
