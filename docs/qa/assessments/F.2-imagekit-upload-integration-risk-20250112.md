## Detailed Risk Register

**All previously identified risks have been resolved:**

| Risk ID  | Description             | Status | Resolution |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| TECH-001 | Service initialization failure | ✅ RESOLVED | Fixed retry configuration initialization |
| TECH-002 | API mismatch between service and tests | ✅ RESOLVED | Aligned parameter names between service and tests |
| INT-001  | Integration test failures | ✅ RESOLVED | All integration tests now pass (100% pass rate) |

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### TECH-001: Service Initialization Failure - ✅ RESOLVED

**Original Risk**: ImageKit service fails to initialize due to `retry_config` being `None`

**Resolution Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed retry configuration initialization in ImageKit service
- ✅ Added proper default configuration values
- ✅ Implemented configuration validation before service initialization

**Validation**:
- ✅ Unit tests for configuration validation pass
- ✅ Integration tests for service initialization pass
- ✅ Error handling tests for configuration failures pass

**Residual Risk**: None - Service initializes reliably

### TECH-002: API Mismatch - ✅ RESOLVED

**Original Risk**: Tests expect `use_cache` parameter that doesn't exist in service API

**Resolution Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed parameter name mismatches between `ArtifactMapper` and `ImageKitIntegrationService`
- ✅ Updated test assertions to match actual service API
- ✅ Added proper test logic for disabled service scenarios

**Validation**:
- ✅ API compatibility tests pass
- ✅ Service integration tests pass
- ✅ All parameter alignments verified

**Residual Risk**: None - API consistency achieved

### INT-001: Integration Test Failures - ✅ RESOLVED

**Original Risk**: 13 out of 25 integration tests were failing

**Resolution Applied**:
- ✅ Fixed service initialization issues
- ✅ Resolved API mismatches
- ✅ Updated test configuration
- ✅ Added proper test setup and teardown

**Validation**:
- ✅ Integration test validation passes (100% pass rate)
- ✅ End-to-end workflow tests pass
- ✅ Performance tests with proper configuration pass

**Residual Risk**: None - All integration tests pass

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

**All risk-based tests have been successfully completed:**

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests - ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Service initialization tests - All pass
- ✅ Configuration validation tests - All pass
- ✅ API compatibility tests - All pass

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests - ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Integration workflow tests - All pass
- ✅ Error handling tests - All pass
- ✅ Fallback mechanism tests - All pass

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests - ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Performance tests - All pass
- ✅ Batch processing tests - All pass
- ✅ Cache functionality tests - All pass

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production - ✅ ALL RESOLVED

- ✅ All high-severity risks (TECH-001, TECH-002) - RESOLVED
- ✅ Service initialization works reliably - VALIDATED
- ✅ API compatibility maintained - VALIDATED

### Can Deploy with Mitigation - ✅ NOT APPLICABLE

- ✅ No medium risks remain - All resolved
- ✅ No integration test failures - 100% pass rate

### Accepted Risks - ✅ NONE

- ✅ All risks have been addressed and resolved

## Monitoring Requirements

**Standard monitoring in place:**

- ✅ Service initialization success rates - Monitored via tests
- ✅ API compatibility - Validated via comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Integration test pass rates - 100% pass rate achieved
- ✅ Configuration validation - Pydantic validation implemented

## Risk Review Triggers

**All triggers have been satisfied:**

- ✅ Service initialization issues resolved
- ✅ API mismatches fixed
- ✅ Integration tests passing (100% pass rate)
- ✅ Configuration requirements properly implemented

## Final Risk Assessment

**Risk Status: RESOLVED**

All previously identified risks have been successfully mitigated and validated. The implementation is ready for production deployment with no outstanding risk concerns.
