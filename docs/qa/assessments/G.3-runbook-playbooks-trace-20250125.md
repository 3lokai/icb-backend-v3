**Note**: This AC is marked as PARTIAL because Firecrawl is not yet implemented, so procedures are skipped as documented in the story.

#### AC6: Runbook is stored in repository and accessible to all team members

**Coverage: FULL**

  - When: Team members follow complete access workflow
  - Then: Runbooks are accessible and usable by all team members

#### AC7: Tabletop drill validates runbook procedures with ops team runthrough

**Coverage: NOT COVERED**

**Gap**: No test coverage found for tabletop drill validation
- **Reason**: Tabletop drill is a manual process that cannot be automated
- **Risk**: High - Procedures may not work in practice without validation
- **Action**: Schedule and execute tabletop drill with ops team

#### AC8: Emergency contact information and escalation procedures are documented

  - Then: Troubleshooting procedures work correctly and resolve issues

### Critical Gaps

1. **Tabletop Drill Validation (AC7)**
   - Gap: No automated test coverage for tabletop drill
   - Risk: High - Procedures may not work in practice without validation
   - Action: Schedule and execute tabletop drill with ops team

2. **Firecrawl Procedures (AC5)**
   - Gap: Firecrawl procedures are skipped (not implemented)
   - Risk: Medium - Future Firecrawl implementation may lack procedures
   - Action: Implement Firecrawl procedures when Firecrawl is implemented

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1. **Additional test scenarios needed**:
   - Tabletop drill validation (manual process)
   - Firecrawl procedure testing (when implemented)

2. **Test types to implement**:
   - Manual testing for tabletop drill
   - Integration testing for Firecrawl (when implemented)

3. **Test data requirements**:
   - Incident scenarios for tabletop drill
   - Firecrawl service data (when implemented)

4. **Mock/stub strategies**:
   - Mock incident scenarios for tabletop drill
   - Mock Firecrawl service for testing (when implemented)

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: AC7 (Tabletop drill validation) - No coverage, critical for procedure validation
- **Medium Risk**: AC5 (Firecrawl procedures) - Partial coverage, future implementation needed
- **Low Risk**: All other ACs - Full coverage with unit, integration, and E2E tests

### Coverage Quality Indicators

Good traceability shows:
- ✅ Every AC has at least one test (except AC7)
- ✅ Critical paths have multiple test levels
- ✅ Edge cases are explicitly covered
- ✅ NFRs have appropriate test types
- ✅ Clear Given-When-Then for each test

### Red Flags Addressed

- ⚠️ AC7 with no test coverage (manual process)
- ✅ Tests map to requirements
- ✅ Test descriptions are clear
- ✅ Edge cases are covered
- ✅ NFRs have specific tests

### Integration with Gates

This traceability feeds into quality gates:

- Critical gaps → CONCERNS (AC7 tabletop drill)
- Minor gaps → CONCERNS (AC5 Firecrawl)
- Missing P0 tests from test-design → CONCERNS

### Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Schedule tabletop drill with ops team
   - Document tabletop drill results and improvements

2. **Future Actions**:
   - Implement Firecrawl procedures when Firecrawl is implemented
   - Regular review and update of runbook procedures

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Track runbook usage and effectiveness
   - Monitor procedure accuracy and completeness
   - Regular validation of emergency contacts
