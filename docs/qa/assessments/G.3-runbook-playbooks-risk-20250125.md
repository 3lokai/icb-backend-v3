## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **OPS-001**: Test all documented procedures for completeness and accuracy
- **OPS-002**: Verify all emergency contact information is current and accessible

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **OPS-003**: Validate runbook procedures against current system state
- **OPS-004**: Conduct tabletop drill to validate procedures
- **TECH-001**: Test execution of documented procedures
- **TECH-002**: Verify integration points with monitoring tools

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- **BUS-001**: Verify runbook accessibility and permissions
- **BUS-002**: Cross-reference procedures with actual system behavior

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (OPS-001, OPS-002) must be addressed
- Emergency contact information must be current and accessible
- All critical procedures must be documented and tested

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks can be addressed post-deployment with monitoring
- Low risks are acceptable with proper documentation

### Accepted Risks

- Some procedures may need updates as system evolves
- Tabletop drill validation may be scheduled post-deployment

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Runbook usage and effectiveness
- Emergency contact accessibility
- Procedure accuracy and completeness
- Team adoption and feedback

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- System architecture changes significantly
- New monitoring tools are added
- Emergency procedures are updated
- Team structure changes
- Incident response procedures evolve

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### OPS-001: Incomplete runbook procedures
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Comprehensive review of all operational procedures
- Cross-reference with actual system capabilities
- Include step-by-step validation for each procedure
**Testing Requirements**:
- Procedure completeness checklist
- End-to-end procedure testing
**Residual Risk**: Low - Some edge cases may not be covered
**Owner**: dev
**Timeline**: Before deployment

### OPS-002: Missing emergency contact information
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Collect and verify all emergency contact information
- Ensure contacts are current and accessible
- Include escalation procedures
**Testing Requirements**:
- Contact information verification
- Escalation procedure testing
**Residual Risk**: Low - Contacts may change over time
**Owner**: po
**Timeline**: Before deployment

### OPS-003: Outdated runbook procedures
**Strategy**: Detective
**Actions**:
- Implement regular runbook review schedule
- Version control for runbook updates
- Change notification system
**Testing Requirements**:
- Version control testing
- Update notification testing
**Residual Risk**: Medium - Requires ongoing maintenance
**Owner**: sm
**Timeline**: Ongoing

### OPS-004: Inadequate tabletop drill validation
**Strategy**: Corrective
**Actions**:
- Schedule regular tabletop drills
- Document drill results and improvements
- Update procedures based on drill feedback
**Testing Requirements**:
- Drill scenario testing
- Feedback integration testing
**Residual Risk**: Medium - Requires team coordination
**Owner**: sm
**Timeline**: Post-deployment
