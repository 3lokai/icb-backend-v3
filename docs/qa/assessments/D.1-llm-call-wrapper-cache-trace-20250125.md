## Critical Gaps

**No gaps identified** - All acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage.

## Test Design Recommendations

Based on comprehensive coverage analysis:

1. **Maintain Current Coverage**: Continue monitoring test coverage as code evolves
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track cache hit rates and API response times in production
3. **Error Scenario Testing**: Continue testing edge cases and error conditions
4. **Integration Validation**: Maintain real API integration tests with current versions

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: All requirements have full test coverage
- **No Gaps**: Every acceptance criterion is validated through multiple test levels
- **Comprehensive**: Unit, integration, and performance tests cover all scenarios

## Quality Indicators

**Excellent traceability demonstrates:**

- Every AC has at least one test
- Critical paths have multiple test levels (unit + integration)
- Edge cases are explicitly covered
- Real API integration validates end-to-end functionality
- Performance requirements have dedicated tests

## Red Flags

**No red flags identified** - Comprehensive test coverage with no gaps or missing scenarios.

## Integration with Gates

This traceability contributes to quality gates:

- **Full coverage** → PASS contribution
- **No gaps** → No CONCERNS
- **Comprehensive testing** → High confidence in implementation quality
