# Risk Profile: Story H.2

Date: 2025-01-12
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 85/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified - all risks are manageable with appropriate mitigation.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Performance: 1 risk (1 high)
- Data: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Integration: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Testing: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Operational: 1 risk (0 critical)

### By Component

- Test Execution: 2 risks
- Sample Data: 1 risk
- External Services: 1 risk
- Performance: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|------------|
| PERF-001 | Large sample data processing time > 5 minutes | Medium | High | 6 | High | Performance monitoring, timeout handling, data chunking |
| DATA-001 | Sample data corruption or incomplete processing | Low | High | 3 | Medium | Data validation, integrity checks, backup procedures |
| INT-001 | ImageKit service failures during testing | Medium | Medium | 4 | Medium | Mock external services, retry logic, fallback procedures |
| TEST-001 | Test flakiness due to external dependencies | Medium | Medium | 4 | Medium | Test isolation, mock services, deterministic test data |
| OPS-001 | Test execution time > 10 minutes | Low | Medium | 2 | Low | Performance optimization, parallel execution, test selection |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- Performance tests with large sample datasets
- Timeout and memory limit testing
- Data integrity validation tests

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Integration tests with external service mocking
- Error handling tests with malformed data
- Test isolation and cleanup verification

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional integration tests
- Basic performance regression tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score â‰¥ 6) must be mitigated
- Performance requirements must be met
- Data integrity must be verified

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with appropriate monitoring
- Low risks with documented procedures

### Accepted Risks

- None - all risks have mitigation strategies

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Test execution performance metrics
- Sample data processing success rates
- External service integration health
- Memory usage and processing times

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Sample data structure changes significantly
- New external services are integrated
- Performance requirements are modified
- Test execution patterns change
