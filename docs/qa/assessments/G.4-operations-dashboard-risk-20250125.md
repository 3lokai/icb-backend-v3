## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 1
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Medium Risks: 0
- Low Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 95/100 (calculated)

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Security: 1 risk (1 low)
- Performance: 0 risks
- Data: 0 risks
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 0 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
|---------|-------------|-------------|--------|-------|----------|
| SEC-003 | No rate limiting on APIs | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Low |

## Resolved Risks

| Risk ID | Description | Resolution |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| SEC-001 | No authentication on dashboard | ✅ **RESOLVED**: Comprehensive Supabase authentication with role-based access control implemented |
| SEC-002 | Hardcoded secret key fallback | ✅ **RESOLVED**: Proper environment variable management implemented |

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### SEC-003: No Rate Limiting

**Risk**: API endpoints vulnerable to abuse
**Mitigation**:
- Add Flask-Limiter middleware
- Implement per-IP rate limiting
- Add monitoring for abuse patterns

**Testing Focus**: Rate limiting testing, abuse scenario testing

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Security Tests

- Authentication flow testing
- Session management testing
- Rate limiting validation
- Input validation testing

### Priority 2: Integration Tests

- Database connection testing
- Monitoring service integration
- Error handling scenarios

### Priority 3: Performance Tests

- Dashboard load testing
- Mobile responsiveness testing
- Real-time update performance

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All medium security risks (SEC-001, SEC-002)
- Authentication and authorization system
- Proper secret management

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Rate limiting can be added post-deployment
- Performance optimizations can be iterative

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Authentication failures and patterns
- API usage patterns and abuse detection
- Dashboard performance metrics
- Error rates and system health

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Authentication system is implemented
- Rate limiting is added
- Performance issues are reported
- Security vulnerabilities are discovered
