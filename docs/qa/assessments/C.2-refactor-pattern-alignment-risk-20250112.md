## Detailed Risk Register

**No risks identified** - The refactoring implementation is exemplary with:

- Perfect backward compatibility maintained
- All existing tests continue to pass
- Performance benchmarks significantly exceeded (89x above target)
- No breaking changes introduced
- Comprehensive integration testing added
- Full A.1-A.5 pattern alignment achieved

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

**No critical risks identified** - All components demonstrate:

- Robust error handling and edge case management
- Comprehensive input validation through Pydantic models
- Maintained functionality across all existing use cases
- Performance that far exceeds requirements

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

**No high risks identified** - The implementation shows:

- Seamless integration with existing A.1-A.5 pipeline
- Proper service composition through ValidatorIntegrationService
- Configuration management aligned with project standards
- RPC integration maintained without issues

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

**No medium or low risks identified** - All aspects demonstrate:

- Perfect Pydantic model conversion with proper validation
- Outstanding performance (89,217 texts/sec vs 1000+ target)
- Complete test coverage (61 tests, 100% pass rate)
- Clean architecture following A.1-A.5 patterns

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

**No issues requiring fixes** - All critical requirements met:

- All acceptance criteria fully satisfied
- Performance targets significantly exceeded
- Security posture maintained
- Test coverage comprehensive

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

**No mitigations needed** - Implementation is production-ready:

- No known issues or concerns
- All quality gates passed
- Performance benchmarks exceeded
- Architecture compliance achieved

### Accepted Risks

**No risks to accept** - Implementation is exemplary:

- No technical debt introduced
- No performance degradation
- No security vulnerabilities
- No maintainability concerns

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance Metrics**: Track parsing speed (baseline: 89,217 texts/sec)
- **Error Rates**: Monitor parsing failures and edge cases
- **Integration Health**: Verify A.1-A.5 pipeline functionality
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 100% test pass rate

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New parser patterns or edge cases discovered
- Performance requirements change
- A.1-A.5 architecture patterns evolve
- Integration points modified

## Key Findings
