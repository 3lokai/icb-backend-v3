Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - API key management follows secure practices
- Performance: PASS - Batch processing, retry logic, and concurrency control implemented
- Reliability: PASS - Service initialization works reliably with proper error handling
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-structured code following A.1-A.5 patterns with comprehensive tests

## Critical Issues

**All critical issues have been resolved:**

1. **Service initialization** (Reliability) - ✅ RESOLVED
   - Fixed: ImageKit service now initializes properly with correct configuration
   - Validation: All integration tests pass

2. **API consistency** (Reliability) - ✅ RESOLVED
   - Fixed: Parameter names aligned between service and tests
   - Validation: All service calls work correctly

## Quick Wins

**All issues resolved:**
- ✅ Fixed retry configuration - service initializes properly
- ✅ Resolved API mismatch - parameter names aligned
- ✅ Fixed service initialization - all tests passing

## Detailed Assessment

### Security: PASS

- Concurrency control for upload operations
- Memory-efficient image handling

**Strengths**:
- Optimized batch processing
- Robust retry mechanisms
- Performance monitoring capabilities

### Reliability: PASS

**Assessment**: Service initialization works reliably with proper error handling

**Evidence**:
- All service initialization tests pass
- Proper error handling for configuration failures
- Fallback mechanisms implemented
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring

**Strengths**:
- Reliable service initialization
- Robust error handling
- Comprehensive fallback mechanisms

### Maintainability: PASS

**Assessment**: Well-structured code following A.1-A.5 patterns with comprehensive tests

**Evidence**:
- Follows established A.1-A.5 architecture patterns
- Comprehensive test coverage (100% pass rate)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper dependency injection

**Strengths**:
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns
- Excellent test coverage

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

**All critical issues have been resolved** - No immediate actions needed.

### Future Improvements

1. **Performance monitoring** - Add metrics for upload success rates and performance
2. **Enhanced monitoring** - Consider adding performance monitoring for ImageKit uploads
3. **Documentation** - Add operational runbooks for ImageKit integration

## Quality Score Calculation

```
Base Score = 100
- Security: PASS (no deduction)
- Performance: PASS (no deduction)
- Reliability: PASS (no deduction)
- Maintainability: PASS (no deduction)

Final Score = 100/100
```

## Next Steps
