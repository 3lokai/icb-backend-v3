  - When: Alert throttling is applied
  - Then: Duplicate alerts are prevented

- **Integration Test**: `test_price_alert_service_integration.py::test_slack_webhook`
  - Given: Price spike alert triggered
  - When: Slack webhook is called
  - Then: Alert message is delivered to Slack

#### AC4: Prometheus metrics are exported for monitoring dashboards

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `test_metrics_exporter.py::test_prometheus_format`
  - Given: Metrics data collected
  - When: Prometheus exporter formats metrics
  - Then: Metrics are in correct Prometheus format

- **Integration Test**: `test_metrics_exporter_integration.py::test_prometheus_server`
  - Given: Prometheus server running
  - When: Metrics are exported to server
  - Then: Metrics are available for scraping

#### AC5: Sentry integration captures errors and performance issues

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `test_sentry_integration.py::test_error_capture`
  - Given: Price job error occurs
  - When: Sentry integration captures error
  - Then: Error is sent to Sentry with context

- **Unit Test**: `test_sentry_integration.py::test_performance_capture`
  - Given: Performance threshold exceeded
  - When: Sentry integration captures performance issue
  - Then: Performance issue is reported to Sentry

#### AC6: Threshold test harness validates alerting functionality

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Unit Test**: `test_threshold_test_harness.py::test_price_spike_validation`
  - Given: Test harness with mock alert service
  - When: Price spike test is executed
  - Then: Alert functionality is validated

- **Unit Test**: `test_threshold_test_harness.py::test_backoff_validation`
  - Given: Test harness with mock backoff service
  - When: Backoff test is executed
  - Then: Backoff functionality is validated

#### AC7: Monitoring dashboards show price job health and performance

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `test_monitoring_dashboard.py::test_dashboard_data_availability`
  - Given: Monitoring dashboard with metrics data
  - When: Dashboard queries metrics
  - Then: Price job health data is displayed

- **Integration Test**: `test_monitoring_dashboard.py::test_real_time_updates`
  - Given: Real-time monitoring dashboard
  - When: New metrics data arrives
  - Then: Dashboard updates in real-time

## Critical Gaps

None identified - all acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage.

## Test Design Recommendations

Based on coverage analysis, recommend:

1. **Unit Test Priority**: Focus on core logic testing for metrics collection, backoff calculation, and alert detection
2. **Integration Test Priority**: Test external service integrations (Prometheus, Slack, Sentry)
3. **E2E Test Priority**: Validate complete monitoring and alerting pipeline
4. **Test Data Requirements**: Mock external services for unit tests, use staging services for integration tests

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - all critical paths have test coverage
- **Medium Risk**: None - all integration points are tested
- **Low Risk**: None - comprehensive test coverage achieved

## Quality Indicators

Good traceability shows:

- Every AC has at least one test
- Critical paths have multiple test levels
- Edge cases are explicitly covered
- NFRs have appropriate test types
- Clear Given-When-Then for each test

## Red Flags

None identified - comprehensive test coverage with clear traceability.
