# Gate decision rationale
gate_rationale: |
  The runbook documentation is comprehensive and well-structured, covering all critical operational procedures. 
  The solo validation approach has been completed (Task 7), providing practical validation of procedures.
  Firecrawl procedures are appropriately skipped as the service is not yet implemented.
  
  The documentation quality is high with proper access controls, emergency contacts, and troubleshooting guides.
  The main remaining concern is documentation versioning which is addressable before production deployment.
  
  Gate decision: PASS - Documentation is complete with validation and ready for production.
