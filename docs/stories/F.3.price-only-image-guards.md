# Story F.3: Price-only must not touch images

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** strict enforcement that price-only runs never trigger image uploads or processing,
**so that** I can maintain fast, lightweight price updates without unnecessary image operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Code path guards prevent image processing during price-only runs
2. Unit tests assert image upload/processing not called during price-only execution
3. Integration tests validate price-only pipeline skips all image operations
4. Performance tests confirm price-only runs maintain speed without image overhead
5. Error handling for edge cases where image processing might be triggered
6. Comprehensive logging for price-only vs full pipeline execution paths
7. CI smoke tests validate price-only image guard enforcement

## Dev Technical Guidance

### Existing Infrastructure Integration
[Source: Epic F requirements and B.1-B.3 implementation]

**B.1-B.3 Price-Only Pipeline Integration:**
- **Price Fetcher**: Uses `metadata_only=True` flag in B.1 price-only fetcher ✅ **EXISTS**
- **RPC Integration**: B.2 uses `metadata_only=True` for price-only RPC calls ✅ **EXISTS**
- **Pipeline Flow**: B.3 monitoring tracks price-only vs full pipeline execution ✅ **EXISTS**
- **Guard Enforcement**: Extends existing `metadata_only` flag usage throughout pipeline

**A.1-A.5 Full Pipeline Integration:**
- **Image Processing**: A.1-A.5 pipeline processes images when `metadata_only=False` ✅ **EXISTS**
- **Database Integration**: Full pipeline includes image upserts via RPC calls ✅ **EXISTS**
- **Pipeline Flow**: Full pipeline includes all artifact processing including images ✅ **EXISTS**

### Price-Only Guard Implementation Strategy
[Source: Epic F requirements]

**Guard Implementation Pattern:**
```python
class ImageProcessingGuard:
    def __init__(self, metadata_only: bool):
        self.metadata_only = metadata_only
        self.logger = get_logger(__name__)
    
    def check_image_processing_allowed(self, operation: str) -> bool:
        """Check if image processing is allowed for current operation"""
        if self.metadata_only:
            self.logger.warning(
                "Image processing blocked for price-only run",
                operation=operation,
                metadata_only=self.metadata_only
            )
            return False
        return True
    
    def guard_image_processing(self, operation: str, func: Callable, *args, **kwargs):
        """Guard wrapper for image processing operations"""
        if not self.check_image_processing_allowed(operation):
            self.logger.info(
                "Skipping image processing for price-only run",
                operation=operation
            )
            return None
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
```

**Integration Points:**
- **ArtifactMapper**: Guard `_map_images_data()` when `metadata_only=True`
- **DatabaseIntegration**: Guard image upserts when `metadata_only=True`
- **RPCClient**: Guard `upsert_coffee_image()` when `metadata_only=True`

### Integration Points
[Source: B.1-B.3 and A.1-A.5 implementation patterns]

**B.1-B.3 Price-Only Integration:**
- **Price Fetcher**: B.1 sets `metadata_only=True` for price-only runs
- **RPC Integration**: B.2 uses `metadata_only=True` for price-only RPC calls
- **Monitoring**: B.3 tracks price-only execution metrics
- **Guard Enforcement**: Extend existing `metadata_only` flag usage

**A.1-A.5 Full Pipeline Integration:**
- **Image Processing**: A.1-A.5 processes images when `metadata_only=False`
- **Database Integration**: Full pipeline includes image upserts
- **Pipeline Flow**: Full pipeline includes all artifact processing
