# Story A.2: Shopify/Woo list fetcher (paginated)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** an async paginated fetcher for Shopify and WooCommerce product endpoints,
**so that** the coffee scraper can efficiently retrieve product data from e-commerce platforms with proper rate limiting and concurrency control.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/2-component-architecture.md#2.3]

**Fetcher Pool Specifications:**
- Technology: Async `httpx` workers with semaphores
- Primary Sources: Shopify JSON, WooCommerce REST API
- Fallback: Firecrawl map/extract for JS-heavy sites
- Politeness: 250ms ± 100ms jitter, respect robots.txt
- Caching: ETag/Last-Modified support for bandwidth efficiency
- Source Configuration: Read from `product_sources` table for endpoint configuration

### Core Data Flow
[Source: architecture/1-core-data-flow.md#1.1]

**Full Pipeline (Monthly):**
1. **Fetch** → Store JSON endpoints (Shopify/Woo) as primary source
2. **Validate** → Pydantic v2 validation against canonical artifact schema
3. **Persist** → Raw artifact pointer/hashes to S3/Supabase Storage

### Database Schema Context
[Source: db/tables.md#product_sources]

**Product Sources Configuration (Already Implemented):**
The `product_sources` table contains all necessary endpoint configuration:
- `id` (string) - Primary key
- `roaster_id` (string) - Foreign key to roasters table
- `base_url` (string) - Base URL for the store
- `platform` (platform_enum) - Platform type (shopify, woocommerce, custom, other)
- `products_endpoint` (string) - Specific products endpoint path
- `sitemap_url` (string) - Sitemap URL for discovery
- `robots_ok` (boolean) - Whether robots.txt allows scraping
- `last_ok_ping` (timestamptz) - Last successful ping timestamp

### Technical Implementation Details

**Shopify API Endpoints:**
- Primary: `{domain}/products.json` (paginated)
- Parameters: `limit`, `page`, `created_at_min`, `updated_at_min`
- Rate limiting: 2 calls per second per app
- Authentication: API key in headers

**WooCommerce REST API:**
- Primary: `/wp-json/wc/store/products` (paginated)
- Parameters: `per_page`, `page`, `after`, `before`
- Rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes
- Authentication: Consumer key/secret or JWT

### Concurrency and Rate Limiting
[Source: architecture/2-component-architecture.md#2.2]

**Orchestrator & Job Queue:**
- Concurrency: Default 3 workers per roaster (configurable)
- Backoff: Exponential retry (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s) with jitter
- Per-roaster semaphores to prevent overwhelming individual stores

### Caching Strategy
[Source: architecture/2-component-architecture.md#2.3]

**Bandwidth Efficiency:**
- ETag/Last-Modified support for conditional requests
- Store raw responses in temporary storage for validation
- Implement 304 Not Modified handling
- Respect robots.txt for politeness

### Error Handling and Resilience
- Timeout configuration for failed requests
- Exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Graceful degradation when endpoints are unavailable
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/8-development-testing.md#8.1]

**Local Development:**
- Docker Compose: Worker + local Supabase emulator + mock endpoints
- Environment Variables: Same as Fly to minimize surprises
- Testing: Unit tests for fetchers, integration tests with staging DB

**Test Scenarios:**
- Pagination handling for both platforms
- Rate limiting compliance
- Error handling and retry logic
- Caching behavior verification
- Concurrency control testing

### File Locations
Based on the architecture, the fetcher should be structured as:
- Main fetcher service: `src/fetcher/shopify_fetcher.py`
- WooCommerce fetcher: `src/fetcher/woocommerce_fetcher.py`
- Base fetcher class: `src/fetcher/base_fetcher.py`
- Configuration: `src/config/fetcher_config.py`
- Tests: `tests/fetcher/test_shopify_fetcher.py`, `tests/fetcher/test_woocommerce_fetcher.py`

### Integration Points
- **Queue System**: Receives jobs from orchestrator
- **Storage**: Stores raw responses for validator
- **Configuration**: Reads from product_sources table
- **Logging**: Emits metrics for monitoring
- **Next Stage**: Passes raw data to validator for Pydantic validation
