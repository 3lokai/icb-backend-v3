# Story E.3: Firecrawl budget & fallback policy

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** comprehensive budget tracking and fallback policies for Firecrawl operations,
**so that** I can control costs, prevent budget overruns, and ensure reliable fallback behavior when Firecrawl budget is exhausted.

## Business Context
This story implements budget management and fallback policies for Firecrawl operations to ensure cost control and reliable system behavior. When Firecrawl budget is exhausted, the system must gracefully fall back to alternative methods or alert operations for manual intervention, preventing unexpected costs and ensuring continuous operation.

## Dependencies
**âœ… COMPLETED: Core infrastructure exists:**
- **E.1 Firecrawl Map Discovery**: Product URL discovery with budget tracking implementation
- **E.2 Firecrawl Extract**: Product extraction with budget integration
- **G.1-G.4 Monitoring**: Observability and alerting infrastructure
- **A.1-A.5 Pipeline**: Job queue and error handling systems
- **Database Schema**: Roaster configuration with budget fields
- **Budget Tracking**: FirecrawlBudgetTracker and budget monitoring already implemented

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Budget management service for operations team control and monitoring
2. Budget exhaustion detection and automatic fallback behavior
3. Roaster flagging when budget exhausted with appropriate alerts
4. Budget reporting and analytics for cost monitoring and forecasting
5. Integration with existing G.1-G.4 monitoring and alerting system
6. State persistence for budget tracking across system restarts
7. Budget reset and management capabilities for operations team
8. Comprehensive test coverage for budget scenarios and edge cases

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/2-component-architecture.md#2.2]

**Budget Management Integration:**
- **E.1 Map Discovery**: Budget decrement for map operations
- **E.2 Extract Operations**: Budget decrement for extract operations
- **G.1-G.4 Monitoring**: Budget alerts and reporting
- **A.1-A.5 Pipeline**: Job queue integration with budget checks
- **Database Schema**: Budget tracking and state persistence

### Budget Management Implementation
[Source: existing E.1 budget tracking and database patterns]

**Budget Management Features:**
- **Budget Allocation**: Distribute budget across roasters based on priority
- **Budget Monitoring**: Track usage patterns and cost trends
- **Budget Recovery**: Replenish exhausted budgets and reset limits
- **Budget Analytics**: Cost analysis and forecasting for operations planning

**Integration with E.1 Budget Tracking:**
- **Existing**: FirecrawlBudgetTracker from E.1 handles operational budget tracking
- **New**: FirecrawlBudgetManagementService for operations team control
- **Database**: Extend existing budget fields with management capabilities
- **API**: Operations team interface for budget control and monitoring

### Fallback Policy Implementation
[Source: existing error handling and fallback patterns]

**Fallback Scenarios:**
- **Budget Exhausted**: Disable Firecrawl, fallback to manual processing
- **API Failures**: Retry with backoff, then fallback to alternative methods
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement backoff, then fallback to manual processing
- **Data Quality Issues**: Flag for manual review, continue with other roasters

**Fallback Behavior:**
- **Immediate**: Stop Firecrawl operations when budget exhausted
- **Graceful**: Complete in-progress operations before stopping
- **Alerting**: Notify operations team of budget exhaustion
- **Recovery**: Enable Firecrawl when budget replenished

### Monitoring and Alerting Integration
[Source: G.1-G.4 monitoring infrastructure]

**Budget Metrics:**
- **Budget Usage**: Track budget consumption per roaster
- **Budget Trends**: Monitor budget usage patterns over time
- **Budget Health**: Alert when budget approaching exhaustion
- **Cost Analysis**: Track cost per operation and efficiency

**Alerting Thresholds:**
- **Warning**: 80% of budget consumed
- **Critical**: 95% of budget consumed
- **Exhausted**: 100% of budget consumed
- **Recovery**: Budget replenished after exhaustion

### Database Schema Integration
[Source: existing database schema and patterns]

**Budget Tracking Tables:**
- **roasters**: Add budget fields and tracking
- **firecrawl_operations**: Track individual operations and costs
- **budget_alerts**: Store budget alerts and notifications
- **budget_audit**: Audit trail for budget operations

**Budget State Persistence:**
- **Current Budget**: Track remaining budget per roaster
- **Operation History**: Store operation costs and timestamps
- **Alert History**: Track budget alerts and responses
- **Recovery Events**: Log budget replenishment and recovery

### Error Handling and Recovery
[Source: existing error handling patterns]

**Error Scenarios:**
- **Budget Calculation Errors**: Handle budget calculation failures
- **State Persistence Failures**: Handle database update failures
- **Alert Delivery Failures**: Handle alert system failures
- **Recovery Failures**: Handle budget replenishment failures

**Recovery Procedures:**
- **Budget Reset**: Manual budget reset by operations team
- **State Recovery**: Recover budget state from database
- **Alert Recovery**: Retry failed alert deliveries
- **System Recovery**: Restart Firecrawl operations after recovery

## Testing

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run budget tracking tests
python -m pytest tests/firecrawl/test_budget_tracking.py -v

# Run fallback policy tests
python -m pytest tests/firecrawl/test_fallback_policy.py -v
