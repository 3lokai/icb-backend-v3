# Story E.2: Firecrawl extract → artifact normalizer

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** Firecrawl extract to convert scraped product data into canonical artifact format,
**so that** Firecrawl-discovered products can be processed through the existing normalization and validation pipeline.

## Business Context
This story implements Firecrawl extract functionality to scrape individual product pages and convert the output into the canonical artifact format used by the existing A.1-A.5 pipeline. This enables products discovered through Firecrawl map (E.1) to be processed through the same validation, normalization, and database storage pipeline as Shopify/WooCommerce products.

## Dependencies
**✅ COMPLETED: Core infrastructure exists:**
- **E.1 Firecrawl Map Discovery**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Product URL discovery and queuing with budget tracking
- **A.3 Artifact Validation**: Pydantic models for canonical artifact schema
- **A.4 RPC Integration**: Database storage through existing RPC functions
- **C.1-C.8 Normalizer Pipeline**: Text cleaning, parsing, and normalization
- **F.1-F.3 Image Processing**: Image handling and ImageKit integration

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **ENHANCED**: Firecrawl extract service processes individual product URLs with JavaScript rendering
2. **ENHANCED**: Coffee product extraction with dropdown interaction for pricing variations
3. **ENHANCED**: Basic artifact conversion to canonical format (minimal conversion logic)
4. **SIMPLIFIED**: Integration with existing C.1-C.8 normalizer pipeline for all text processing
5. **SIMPLIFIED**: Image processing integration with F.1-F.3 image handling pipeline
6. **ENHANCED**: Comprehensive test coverage with JavaScript-heavy coffee roaster sites
7. **SIMPLIFIED**: Basic error handling and retry logic for extract operations

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/2-component-architecture.md#2.2]

**Firecrawl Extract Integration:**
- **E.1 Map Discovery**: Provides product URLs for extraction
- **A.3 Artifact Validation**: Validates Firecrawl artifacts against schema
- **A.4 RPC Integration**: Stores Firecrawl artifacts in database
- **C.1-C.8 Normalizer**: Processes Firecrawl text and metadata
- **F.1-F.3 Image Processing**: Handles Firecrawl-discovered images

### Firecrawl Extract API Integration
[Source: Firecrawl documentation and existing patterns]

**Firecrawl Extract API:**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /v1/extract` for content extraction
- **Parameters**: URL, extractor, schema, include_links, include_images
- **Response**: Structured product data with metadata
- **Rate Limits**: Respect Firecrawl API rate limits and quotas

**Extraction Configuration:**
- **Extractor**: Use appropriate extractor for e-commerce sites
- **Schema**: Define schema for product data extraction
- **Include Links**: Extract related product links
- **Include Images**: Extract product images and metadata

**Integration with E.1 Map Discovery:**
- **Input**: Product URLs discovered by E.1 FirecrawlMapService (✅ **COMPLETED**)
- **Processing**: Extract individual product pages using Firecrawl extract API
- **Output**: Canonical artifacts ready for A.3 validation and A.4 RPC integration

### Simplified Architecture
[Source: Leverage existing C.1-C.8 normalizer pipeline and F.1-F.3 image processing]

**Core Approach:**
- **Minimal Conversion**: Basic Firecrawl output → canonical artifact format
- **Pipeline Integration**: Feed through existing NormalizerPipelineService
- **Consistent Processing**: Same normalization as Shopify/WooCommerce sources
- **Error Handling**: Basic retry logic and error recovery

**Integration Points:**
- **C.1-C.8 Normalizer**: All text processing through existing pipeline
- **F.1-F.3 Image Processing**: Image handling through existing pipeline
- **A.3 Validation**: Artifact validation through existing system
- **A.4 RPC Integration**: Database storage through existing RPC functions
- **JavaScript Rendering**: Firecrawl automatically handles JS-heavy sites
- **Dropdown Interaction**: Page actions for complex pricing dropdowns

**Database Schema Requirements:**
- **✅ NO NEW TABLES**: Uses existing `coffees`, `variants`, `prices` tables
- **✅ NO NEW COLUMNS**: Uses existing schema for Firecrawl-discovered products
- **✅ EXISTING RPC**: Uses existing `rpc_insert_price` and `rpc_upsert_coffee` functions
- **✅ JAVASCRIPT SUPPORT**: Firecrawl handles JS dropdowns and dynamic pricing

### Canonical Artifact Schema Integration
[Source: A.3 artifact validation and existing schema]

**Required Fields Mapping:**
- **source**: Set to 'firecrawl' for Firecrawl-discovered products
- **roaster_domain**: Extract from product URL domain
- **scraped_at**: Current timestamp for extraction
- **product**: Map Firecrawl product data to canonical format

**Product Field Mapping:**
- **platform_product_id**: Extract from Firecrawl product data
- **title**: Map product title from Firecrawl output
- **description_html/md**: Map product description
- **source_url**: Original product URL from map discovery
- **variants**: Convert Firecrawl variants to canonical format
- **images**: Process Firecrawl images through F.1-F.3 pipeline

### Normalizer Pipeline Integration
[Source: C.1-C.8 normalizer pipeline]

**Text Processing:**
- **C.7 Name Description Cleaner**: Clean Firecrawl product titles and descriptions
- **C.3 Tags Normalization**: Process Firecrawl product tags and categories
- **C.5 Varieties Geographic Parser**: Extract geographic and variety information
- **C.6 Sensory Content Hash Parser**: Process sensory information from Firecrawl

**Image Processing:**
- **F.1 Image Hash & Dedupe**: Process Firecrawl images for deduplication
- **F.2 ImageKit Integration**: Upload Firecrawl images to ImageKit
- **F.3 Price-only Guards**: Ensure images processed correctly in price-only mode

### Error Handling and Fallback
[Source: existing error handling patterns]

**Error Scenarios:**
- **Extraction Failures**: Firecrawl API errors or timeouts
- **Data Quality Issues**: Invalid or incomplete product data
- **Schema Validation**: Firecrawl output doesn't match expected format
- **Budget Exhaustion**: Firecrawl budget limit reached

**Fallback Behavior:**
- **Extraction Failures**: Retry with exponential backoff, then mark for manual review
- **Data Quality Issues**: Log warnings, continue with available data
- **Schema Validation**: Store raw data, flag for manual processing
- **Budget Exhaustion**: Disable Firecrawl for roaster, alert operations team

### Performance Considerations
[Source: existing performance patterns]

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple product URLs in parallel
- **Caching**: Cache extraction results to avoid repeated API calls
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Firecrawl API rate limits
- **Budget Management**: Optimize extraction operations to stay within budget

**Monitoring and Metrics:**
- **Extraction Success Rate**: Percentage of successful extractions
- **Data Quality Metrics**: Track completeness and accuracy of extracted data
- **API Performance**: Monitor Firecrawl API response times
- **Budget Usage**: Track budget consumption per roaster
