# Story A.6: Platform-Based Fetcher Selection with Automatic Fallback

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** the scraping system to automatically select the appropriate fetcher based on the roaster's platform field,
**so that** we can ensure optimal cost efficiency with intelligent fallback using existing roaster configuration.

## Business Context
This story implements intelligent fetcher selection using the existing `roasters.platform` field, with automatic cascade through fetchers: Shopify → WooCommerce → Firecrawl. The system leverages existing roaster configuration to minimize costs while ensuring maximum coverage.

## Dependencies
**✅ COMPLETED: Core infrastructure exists:**
- **A.1-A.5 Pipeline**: Worker scaffolding, fetcher services, artifact validation, RPC integration
- **Fetcher Services**: Shopify and WooCommerce fetchers with proper error handling
- **Firecrawl Integration**: E.1 Firecrawl map discovery system
- **Database Schema**: `roasters` table already has `platform` field and configuration
- **Monitoring**: G.1-G.4 observability and alerting infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Worker tasks use `roasters.platform` field for fetcher selection
2. Fetcher selection follows intelligent cascade: Shopify → WooCommerce → Firecrawl
3. Firecrawl fallback triggers automatically when standard fetchers fail
4. **Platform field is updated when successful fetcher is determined (empty → detected platform)**
5. Platform detection service populates `roasters.platform` for new roasters
6. Simple database views provide platform distribution and usage statistics
7. All existing functionality preserved during transition
8. Performance optimization for fetcher cascade operations
9. Comprehensive monitoring for fetcher selection and cascade behavior

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/2-component-architecture.md#2.2]

**Platform-Based Fetcher Selection:**
- **A.1 Worker Scaffolding**: Platform-based job routing and fetcher selection
- **A.2 Fetcher Service**: Intelligent fetcher cascade with failure handling
- **A.3 Artifact Validation**: Standardized validation across all fetcher types
- **A.4 RPC Integration**: Unified RPC processing regardless of fetcher source
- **A.5 Coffee Classification**: Consistent classification across all platforms

### Platform Field Logic
[Source: existing roasters table and cascade approach]

**Platform Field Usage:**
- **If `roasters.platform` is empty/null**: Try cascade and update with successful fetcher
- **If `roasters.platform` is set**: Use that platform first, then cascade if it fails
- **Update Rule**: Only update platform field when a standard fetcher (Shopify/WooCommerce) succeeds
- **Firecrawl Success**: Don't update platform field (keep as 'custom'/'other')

**Cascade Learning:**
- System learns which fetcher works best for each roaster
- Platform field gets updated when successful fetcher is determined
- Future runs use the learned platform for faster execution

### Fetcher Cascade Logic
[Source: existing fetcher services and error handling]

**Cascade Sequence:**
1. **Shopify Fetcher**: Try Shopify API first (fastest, cheapest)
2. **WooCommerce Fetcher**: Try WooCommerce API if Shopify fails
3. **Firecrawl Fallback**: Use Firecrawl if both standard fetchers fail

**Failure Detection:**
- **API Failures**: 4xx/5xx errors, rate limiting, authentication failures
- **Data Failures**: Empty responses, malformed JSON, no products found
- **Timeout Failures**: Request timeouts, connection failures

### Database Schema Context
[Source: docs/db/tables.md - roasters table already has platform field]

**Existing Platform Field:**
The `roasters` table already includes:
- `platform` (platform_enum) - E-commerce platform
- `firecrawl_budget_limit` (number) - Firecrawl budget limit
- `default_concurrency` (number) - Default concurrency setting
- `full_cadence` / `price_cadence` (string) - Scheduling configuration

**Platform Enum Values:**
- `shopify`: Shopify e-commerce platform
- `woocommerce`: WooCommerce platform  
- `custom`: Custom platform
- `other`: Other platform types

**No Migration Needed:**
- Platform field already exists in roasters table
- All necessary configuration fields are present
- Story focuses on using existing schema effectively

### Cost Optimization Strategy
[Source: existing Firecrawl budget tracking]

**Cost-Aware Fetcher Selection:**
- **Primary**: Use cheap, fast API calls (Shopify/WooCommerce)
- **Fallback**: Use expensive Firecrawl only when necessary
- **Budget Tracking**: Monitor Firecrawl usage and costs
- **Alerting**: Notify when Firecrawl budget thresholds reached

### Performance Considerations
[Source: existing performance patterns]

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Fast Failover**: Quick detection of fetcher failures
- **Parallel Attempts**: Try multiple fetchers simultaneously where appropriate
- **Caching**: Cache platform detection results to avoid repeated detection
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect platform-specific rate limits
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track cascade timing and success rates

## Testing
