# Story: E.4 Firecrawl Price-Only Workflow

## Status: Ready for Done

## Story

As a **coffee data system**,
I want **Firecrawl price-only workflow integration**,
So that **I can efficiently update coffee prices using Firecrawl as a fallback when standard APIs fail, while minimizing costs through price-only extraction**.

## Context

**Epic E Firecrawl Integration - Price-Only Workflow**

This story creates a specialized price-only workflow for Firecrawl that integrates with Epic B's price-only infrastructure, leveraging existing services from E.1, E.2, and E.3.

**✅ COMPLETED: Core infrastructure exists:**
- **E.1 Firecrawl Map Discovery**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Product URL discovery and queuing with budget tracking
- **E.2 Firecrawl Extract**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Product extraction and normalization
- **E.3 Firecrawl Budget**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - Budget management and error handling
- **Epic B Price-Only Infrastructure**: B.1 price fetcher, B.2 price updates, B.3 monitoring
- **Existing Job Type System**: `job_type: "price_only"` support in fetcher configuration

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Price-Only Firecrawl Integration**: Firecrawl services support `job_type: "price_only"` for cost optimization
2. **Epic B Pipeline Integration**: Seamless integration with B.1 price fetcher and B.2 price updates
3. **Cost Optimization**: Price-only mode reduces Firecrawl API costs by 60-80%
4. **Existing Service Leverage**: Reuse E.1 map discovery, E.2 extract, and E.3 budget services
5. **Monitoring Integration**: Price-only operations tracked in B.3 monitoring system
6. **Database Compliance**: No new tables or columns required - uses existing schema
7. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test coverage for price-only workflow scenarios

### Price-Only Implementation
[Source: Epic B price-only patterns and existing Firecrawl services]

**Price-Only Map Discovery:**
```python
class FirecrawlMapService:
    async def discover_price_only_urls(
        self, 
        domain: str, 
        job_type: str = "price_only"
    ) -> List[str]:
        if job_type == "price_only":
            # Filter for price-relevant pages only
            return await self._discover_price_pages(domain)
        else:
            return await self._discover_all_product_pages(domain)
```

**Price-Only Extract Service:**
```python
class FirecrawlExtractService:
    async def extract_price_only_data(
        self, 
        url: str, 
        job_type: str = "price_only"
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        if job_type == "price_only":
            # Extract only price/availability data
            return await self._extract_price_data(url)
        else:
            return await self._extract_full_product_data(url)
```

**Epic B Integration:**
```python
class FirecrawlPriceOnlyWorkflow:
    def __init__(self, map_service, extract_service, price_fetcher, price_updater):
        self.map_service = map_service
        self.extract_service = extract_service
        self.price_fetcher = price_fetcher  # B.1
        self.price_updater = price_updater  # B.2
    
    async def execute_price_only_workflow(self, roaster_id: str):
        # 1. Discover price-relevant URLs
        urls = await self.map_service.discover_price_only_urls(domain)
        
        # 2. Extract price data
        price_data = await self.extract_service.extract_price_only_data(url)
        
        # 3. Process through B.1 price fetcher
        processed_prices = await self.price_fetcher.process_price_data(price_data)
        
        # 4. Update via B.2 price updater
        await self.price_updater.update_prices(processed_prices)
```

### Database Schema Requirements
[Source: Existing database schema and Epic B infrastructure]

**Database Integration:**
- **✅ NO NEW TABLES**: Uses existing `roasters`, `coffees`, `variants`, `prices` tables
- **✅ NO NEW COLUMNS**: Uses existing `job_type`, `firecrawl_budget_limit` fields
- **✅ EXISTING RPC**: Uses existing `rpc_insert_price` and `rpc_upsert_coffee` functions
- **✅ EXISTING MONITORING**: Integrates with existing G.1-G.4 monitoring tables

**Price-Only Data Flow:**
- **Input**: Roaster domain with `use_firecrawl_fallback=true`
- **Processing**: Price-only map discovery → price-only extract → B.1 price processing → B.2 price updates
- **Output**: Updated prices in existing `prices` table via existing RPC functions

### Cost Optimization Strategy
[Source: Epic B cost optimization and E.3 budget management]

**Price-Only Cost Benefits:**
- **60-80% Cost Reduction**: Price-only operations use significantly less Firecrawl API quota
- **Frequent Updates**: More price updates within same budget allocation
- **Targeted Extraction**: Only extract price-relevant pages and data
- **Budget Efficiency**: Maximize price update frequency within budget constraints

**Budget Tracking:**
- **Cost Tracking**: Track price-only vs full refresh costs separately
- **Budget Allocation**: Allocate budget between price-only and full refresh operations
- **Efficiency Metrics**: Monitor price-only budget efficiency and ROI
- **Alerting**: Alert when price-only budget approaches limits

## Testing

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Unit Tests**: Price-only map discovery and extract functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Epic B pipeline integration (B.1, B.2, B.3)
- **Cost Tests**: Price-only cost optimization and budget tracking
