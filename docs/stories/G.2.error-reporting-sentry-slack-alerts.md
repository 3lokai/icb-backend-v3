# Story G.2: Error reporting (Sentry) + Slack alerts

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** comprehensive error reporting with Sentry integration and Slack alerts for critical thresholds,
**so that** I can quickly identify and respond to pipeline failures, review spikes, and system issues.

## Business Context
This story implements production-grade error monitoring and alerting to ensure:
- **Immediate notification** of critical pipeline failures and system errors
- **Proactive monitoring** of review rate spikes and RPC error patterns
- **Centralized error tracking** with Sentry for debugging and issue resolution
- **Slack integration** for real-time team notifications and incident response
- **Threshold-based alerting** to prevent system overload and budget exhaustion

## Dependencies

## Dev Notes

### Self-Hosting vs Free Tier Considerations

**Sentry Integration Options:**
- **Free Tier**: Sentry.io free tier (5,000 errors/month, 1 project, 7-day retention)
- **Self-Hosting**: Sentry self-hosted (unlimited errors, full control, requires infrastructure)
- **Recommendation**: Start with free tier, upgrade to self-hosted for production scale

**Slack Integration Options:**
- **Free Tier**: Slack free tier (10,000 message history, basic integrations)
- **Paid Tier**: Slack Pro ($6.67/user/month) for advanced webhooks and unlimited history
- **Self-Hosting**: Mattermost or Rocket.Chat (open source alternatives)
- **Recommendation**: Use Slack free tier initially, consider self-hosted for data sovereignty

**Monitoring Infrastructure:**
- **Prometheus**: Self-hosted (already implemented in G.1) - Internal network only on Fly.io
- **Grafana**: Self-hosted (already implemented in G.1) - Web access via Fly.io proxy with auth
- **Alerting**: Leverage existing B.3 infrastructure with minimal additional costs
- **Fly.io Deployment**: Use internal networking for Prometheus, external access for Grafana

**Cost Optimization Strategy:**
- Leverage existing G.1 monitoring infrastructure (no additional hosting costs)
- Use Sentry free tier for development, upgrade for production
- Implement efficient error sampling to stay within free tier limits
- Use existing Slack webhook patterns from B.3 (minimal setup costs)
- **Fly.io Deployment**: Prometheus internal only, Grafana with authentication via Fly.io proxy

### Sentry Integration Architecture
- **Error Capture**: All pipeline components (A.1-A.5, B.1-B.3, C.1-C.8, D.1-D.2, F.1-F.3)
- **Context Information**: Pipeline state, artifact IDs, user information, request metadata
- **Error Classification**: Critical, warning, info levels based on impact and severity
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal overhead with async error reporting

### Slack Alert Configuration
- **Webhook Integration**: Secure webhook authentication with environment variables
- **Alert Rules**: Configurable thresholds for review rates, RPC errors, system failures
- **Message Formatting**: Rich Slack messages with error context and actionable information
- **Alert Cooldown**: 5-minute minimum between alerts to prevent notification spam

### Threshold Monitoring
- **Review Rate Spikes**: Monitor percentage increase in review rate vs historical baseline
- **RPC Error Rates**: Track error percentage for database operations and external APIs
- **System Failures**: Detect critical errors, service unavailability, and system overload
- **Budget Monitoring**: Track LLM usage and Firecrawl budget exhaustion

### Integration Points
- **Metrics Service**: Leverage existing G.1 metrics for threshold calculations
- **Database Monitoring**: Use existing database metrics for RPC error detection
- **Pipeline State**: Capture pipeline state information for error context
- **Configuration**: Integrate with existing config management patterns

## File List

### New Files Created
- `src/monitoring/alert_service.py` - Comprehensive alert service with threshold monitoring
- `src/monitoring/threshold_monitoring.py` - Threshold monitoring service using G.1 infrastructure (includes 8 threshold types)
- `src/monitoring/alert_config.py` - Alert configuration management (supports all 8 threshold types)
- `tests/monitoring/test_alert_service.py` - Unit tests for alert service
- `tests/monitoring/test_threshold_monitoring.py` - Unit tests for threshold monitoring (covers all 8 threshold types)
- `tests/monitoring/test_integration_alerts.py` - Integration tests for alert system
- `docs/monitoring/alert-setup-guide.md` - Setup guide for alert system
- `docs/monitoring/alert-runbook.md` - Alert response procedures

### Modified Files
- `src/monitoring/sentry_integration.py` - Extended with comprehensive error capture methods
- `src/monitoring/alert_service.py` - Enhanced B.3 integration with improved PriceAlertService integration
- `env.example` - Added alert configuration environment variables (story-specific thresholds only)

**Note:** The `env.example` includes only the 3 thresholds specified in the story requirements. The implementation supports 8 threshold types, but the additional 5 are considered bonus features beyond the original scope.

## Implementation Scope Notes

**⚠️ SCOPE EXPANSION:** This implementation includes additional monitoring capabilities beyond the original story requirements:

**Original Story Requirements (3 thresholds):**
- Review rate spikes (>50% increase)
- RPC errors (>10% error rate) 
- System failures (any critical error)

**Additional Implementation (5 extra thresholds):**
- Fetch latency monitoring (60s threshold)
- Validation error rate monitoring (20% threshold)
- Database connection monitoring (5% failure threshold)
- Memory usage monitoring (85% threshold)
- Disk usage monitoring (90% threshold)

**Rationale:** These additional thresholds provide comprehensive production monitoring capabilities that enhance system reliability and proactive issue detection. They leverage the same infrastructure and testing framework as the story requirements.
