### Rate Limit Backoff Strategy
[Source: architecture/2-component-architecture.md#2.2]

**Exponential Backoff Implementation:**
```python
class RateLimitBackoff:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_delay = 1.0  # seconds
        self.max_delay = 300.0  # 5 minutes
        self.multiplier = 2.0
        self.jitter_range = 0.1
    
    async def execute_with_backoff(self, operation: Callable) -> Any:
        """Execute operation with exponential backoff on rate limits"""
        delay = self.base_delay
        attempt = 0
        
        while attempt < self.max_attempts:
            try:
                return await operation()
            except RateLimitError as e:
                if attempt >= self.max_attempts - 1:
                    raise
                
                # Calculate delay with jitter
                jitter = random.uniform(-self.jitter_range, self.jitter_range)
                actual_delay = delay * (1 + jitter)
                
                await asyncio.sleep(actual_delay)
                delay = min(delay * self.multiplier, self.max_delay)
                attempt += 1
```

**Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
```python
class CircuitBreaker:
    def __init__(self, failure_threshold: int = 5, timeout: int = 60):
        self.failure_threshold = failure_threshold
        self.timeout = timeout
        self.failure_count = 0
        self.last_failure_time = None
        self.state = "CLOSED"  # CLOSED, OPEN, HALF_OPEN
    
    async def call(self, operation: Callable) -> Any:
        if self.state == "OPEN":
            if time.time() - self.last_failure_time > self.timeout:
                self.state = "HALF_OPEN"
            else:
                raise CircuitBreakerOpenError()
        
        try:
            result = await operation()
            self._on_success()
            return result
        except Exception as e:
            self._on_failure()
            raise
```

### Prometheus Metrics Integration
[Source: architecture/8-development-testing.md#8.3]

**Metrics Collection:**
```python
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge, start_http_server

# Price job metrics
price_job_duration = Histogram('price_job_duration_seconds', 'Price job execution time')
price_changes_count = Counter('price_changes_total', 'Total price changes detected')
price_job_success = Counter('price_job_success_total', 'Successful price jobs')
price_job_failures = Counter('price_job_failures_total', 'Failed price jobs')
database_connections = Gauge('database_connections_active', 'Active database connections')
rate_limit_errors = Counter('rate_limit_errors_total', 'Rate limit errors encountered')
```

**Metrics Export:**
```python
class MetricsExporter:
    def __init__(self, port: int = 8000):
        self.port = port
        start_http_server(port)
    
    def record_price_job_duration(self, duration: float):
        price_job_duration.observe(duration)
    
    def record_price_changes(self, count: int):
        price_changes_count.inc(count)
    
    def record_job_success(self):
        price_job_success.inc()
    
    def record_job_failure(self, error_type: str):
        price_job_failures.labels(error_type=error_type).inc()
```

### Slack Alerting Integration
[Source: Epic B requirements]

**Alert Service Implementation:**
```python
class PriceAlertService:
    def __init__(self, slack_webhook_url: str, sentry_dsn: str):
        self.slack_client = SlackClient(slack_webhook_url)
        self.sentry_client = SentryClient(dsn=sentry_dsn)
        self.alert_throttle = AlertThrottle()
    
    async def check_price_spike(self, price_deltas: List[PriceDelta]) -> None:
        """Check for price spikes and send alerts"""
        for delta in price_deltas:
            if self._is_price_spike(delta):
                await self._send_price_spike_alert(delta)
    
    def _is_price_spike(self, delta: PriceDelta) -> bool:
        """Determine if price change constitutes a spike"""
        if delta.old_price == 0:
            return False
        
        increase_pct = ((delta.new_price - delta.old_price) / delta.old_price) * 100
        return increase_pct > 50.0  # 50% threshold
    
    async def _send_price_spike_alert(self, delta: PriceDelta) -> None:
        """Send Slack alert for price spike"""
        if self.alert_throttle.should_throttle(delta.variant_id):
            return
        
        message = {
            "text": f"ðŸš¨ Price Spike Alert",
            "attachments": [{
                "color": "danger",
                "fields": [
                    {"title": "Variant ID", "value": delta.variant_id, "short": True},
                    {"title": "Old Price", "value": f"${delta.old_price:.2f}", "short": True},
                    {"title": "New Price", "value": f"${delta.new_price:.2f}", "short": True},
                    {"title": "Increase", "value": f"{((delta.new_price - delta.old_price) / delta.old_price) * 100:.1f}%", "short": True}
                ]
            }]
        }
        
        await self.slack_client.send_message(message)
        self.alert_throttle.record_alert(delta.variant_id)
```

### Sentry Integration
[Source: Epic B requirements]

**Error Tracking and Performance Monitoring:**
```python
import sentry_sdk
from sentry_sdk.integrations.asyncio import AsyncioIntegration
from sentry_sdk.integrations.httpx import HttpxIntegration

class SentryIntegration:
    def __init__(self, dsn: str, environment: str = "production"):

        )
    
    def capture_price_job_error(self, error: Exception, context: Dict[str, Any]):
        """Capture price job errors with context"""
        with sentry_sdk.push_scope() as scope:

            })
            sentry_sdk.capture_message(f"Performance threshold exceeded: {metric_name}")
```

### Threshold Test Harness

**Test Harness Implementation:**
```python
class ThresholdTestHarness:
    def __init__(self, alert_service: PriceAlertService):
        self.alert_service = alert_service
        self.test_results = []
