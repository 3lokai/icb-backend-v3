# Story E.1: Firecrawl map discovery

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** Firecrawl map discovery to find product URLs for roasters using non-standard platforms (Magento, custom),
**so that** I can scrape roasters that don't have JSON APIs or require browser rendering.

## Business Context
This story implements Firecrawl map discovery as a fallback mechanism for roasters using Magento, custom platforms, or other non-standard e-commerce systems. When Shopify/WooCommerce fetchers fail or return insufficient data, Firecrawl map will discover product URLs that can then be processed through the extract pipeline.

## Dependencies
**✅ COMPLETED: Core infrastructure exists:**
- **A.1-A.5 Pipeline**: Worker scaffolding, fetcher service, artifact validation, RPC integration
- **Configuration System**: Roaster configuration with `use_firecrawl_fallback` and `firecrawl_budget_limit`
- **Queue System**: Redis-based job queue with retry logic and backoff
- **Database Schema**: Roaster configuration fields for Firecrawl integration
- **Monitoring**: G.1-G.4 observability and alerting infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Firecrawl client integration with proper authentication and configuration
2. Map discovery returns product URLs for roasters with `use_firecrawl_fallback=true`
3. Product URLs are queued for extract processing with proper job metadata
4. Budget tracking decrements `firecrawl_budget_limit` for each map operation
5. Error handling for Firecrawl API failures with appropriate fallback behavior
6. Integration with existing A.1-A.5 pipeline architecture and patterns
7. Comprehensive test coverage for map discovery functionality
8. Performance optimization for batch URL discovery operations

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/2-component-architecture.md#2.2]

**Firecrawl Integration Points:**
- **A.1 Worker Scaffolding**: Firecrawl jobs integrated with existing job queue
- **A.2 Fetcher Service**: Firecrawl map as fallback when JSON endpoints fail
- **A.3 Artifact Validation**: Firecrawl output validated against existing schema
- **A.4 RPC Integration**: Firecrawl artifacts processed through existing RPC pipeline
- **A.5 Coffee Classification**: Firecrawl products classified using existing logic

### Firecrawl API Integration
[Source: Firecrawl documentation and existing patterns]

**Firecrawl Map API:**
- **Endpoint**: `POST /v1/map` for domain mapping
- **Parameters**: URL, max_pages, search, include_links, include_images
- **Response**: Array of discovered URLs with metadata
- **Rate Limits**: Respect Firecrawl API rate limits and quotas

**Configuration Requirements:**
- **API Key**: Firecrawl API key from environment variables
- **Base URL**: Firecrawl API base URL configuration
- **Timeout**: Request timeout configuration
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for API failures

### Roaster Configuration Integration
[Source: src/config/roaster_schema.py]

**Firecrawl Configuration Fields:**
- `use_firecrawl_fallback`: Boolean flag to enable Firecrawl for roaster
- `firecrawl_budget_limit`: Integer budget limit for Firecrawl operations
- `platform`: Set to 'custom' or 'other' for non-standard platforms
- `website`: Domain URL for Firecrawl mapping

### Job Queue Integration
[Source: existing A.1-A.5 pipeline architecture]

**Job Types:**
- **Map Job**: Discover product URLs for a roaster domain
- **Extract Job**: Process individual product URLs (E.2 story)
- **Fallback Job**: Handle Firecrawl failures and retries

**Job Metadata:**
- Roaster ID and configuration
- Domain URL and mapping parameters
- Budget tracking and limits
- Error handling and retry logic

### Error Handling and Fallback
[Source: existing error handling patterns]

**Error Scenarios:**
- **API Failures**: Firecrawl API unavailable or rate limited
- **Budget Exhaustion**: Firecrawl budget limit reached
- **Invalid Domains**: Domains that don't support mapping
- **Network Issues**: Connectivity problems with Firecrawl API

**Fallback Behavior:**
- **API Failures**: Retry with exponential backoff, then mark roaster for manual review
- **Budget Exhaustion**: Disable Firecrawl for roaster, alert operations team
- **Invalid Domains**: Log error, continue with other roasters
- **Network Issues**: Retry with backoff, then fallback to manual processing

### Performance Considerations
[Source: existing performance patterns]

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Batch Processing**: Process multiple domains in parallel
- **Caching**: Cache map results to avoid repeated API calls
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect Firecrawl API rate limits
- **Budget Management**: Optimize map operations to stay within budget

**Monitoring and Metrics:**
- **Map Success Rate**: Percentage of successful map operations
- **Budget Usage**: Track budget consumption per roaster
- **API Performance**: Monitor Firecrawl API response times
- **Error Rates**: Track and alert on high error rates

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-02

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: The Firecrawl map discovery implementation demonstrates solid architecture and comprehensive functionality. The code follows established A.1-A.5 pipeline patterns with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and extensive monitoring capabilities.

**Strengths Identified**:
- Well-structured configuration management with Pydantic validation
- Comprehensive error handling with custom exception hierarchy
- Robust budget tracking and rate limiting mechanisms
- Extensive monitoring and metrics collection
- Proper integration with existing job queue system
- Good separation between client, service, and configuration layers

### Refactoring Performed

**Integration Test Fixes Applied**:

- **File**: `src/fetcher/firecrawl_map_service.py`
  - **Change**: Fixed constructor parameter - changed from `firecrawl_client.config` to `firecrawl_client.config` (line 39)
  - **Why**: Integration tests were failing due to incorrect attribute access
  - **How**: The service was trying to access `.config` on a FirecrawlConfig object instead of the client

- **File**: `tests/integration/test_firecrawl_integration.py`
  - **Change**: Fixed RoasterConfigSchema instantiation to use correct field names
  - **Why**: Tests were failing due to schema validation errors
  - **How**: Updated field names from `roaster_id` to `id` and `firecrawl_enabled` to `use_firecrawl_fallback`

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Follows established patterns and Python best practices
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Properly integrated with existing A.1-A.5 pipeline architecture
