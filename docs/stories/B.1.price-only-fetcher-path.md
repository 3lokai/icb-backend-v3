# Story B.1: Price-only fetcher path

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** a fast, lightweight price-only fetcher that reads only price fields from list endpoints,
**so that** the coffee scraper can efficiently update prices and availability without the overhead of full product data processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Price-only fetcher reads only price fields from list endpoints (Shopify/WooCommerce)
2. Lightweight parser extracts only price, availability, and variant data
3. Price deltas are detected by comparing with existing `variants.price_current`
4. Missing list endpoints are handled by fetching per-known product handles
5. Job type flag distinguishes price-only from full refresh jobs
6. Price-only runs complete successfully for sample roasters
7. Performance is significantly faster than full product fetches

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Add job type flag and configuration (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add `job_type` parameter to fetcher configuration
  - [ ] Implement price-only mode in fetcher service
  - [ ] Add job type validation and routing logic
  - [ ] Update scheduler to support price-only job scheduling
- [ ] Task 2: Implement lightweight price parser (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create price-only parser that extracts minimal fields
  - [ ] Implement price delta detection logic
  - [ ] Add variant price comparison with existing database values
  - [ ] Handle currency normalization and price formatting
- [ ] Task 3: Handle missing list endpoints (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Implement fallback to per-product handle fetching
  - [ ] Add endpoint availability detection
  - [ ] Create product handle lookup from existing database
  - [ ] Implement graceful degradation for missing endpoints
- [ ] Task 4: Integration with existing fetcher infrastructure (AC: 1, 6, 7)
  - [ ] Extend existing fetcher service with price-only mode
  - [ ] Integrate with A.2 storage system for price data
  - [ ] Add performance monitoring and metrics
  - [ ] Test with sample roasters and verify speed improvements

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/1-core-data-flow.md#1.2]

**Price-Only Pipeline (Weekly):**
1. **Fetch** → Minimal product/variants JSON from list endpoints
2. **Compare** → `price_decimal` vs `variants.price_current`
3. **Update** → `rpc_insert_price` for changes
4. **Sync** → Update `variants.price_current`, `variants.price_last_checked_at`, `variants.in_stock`

### Epic A Foundation Available
[Source: A.1-A.5 completed infrastructure]

**A.1-A.5 Foundation Ready:**
- ✅ **Worker Scaffolding**: Ready to extend with price-only job types
- ✅ **Fetcher Service**: Ready to extend with price-only mode
- ✅ **Storage System**: Ready to store price-only data
- ✅ **Validation Pipeline**: Ready to validate price-only artifacts
- ✅ **RPC Integration**: Ready to extend with price update RPCs

### Price-Only Data Requirements
[Source: architecture/2-component-architecture.md#2.3]

**Minimal Fields Required:**
- `product.platform_product_id` - Product identifier
- `variants[].platform_variant_id` - Variant identifier
- `variants[].price_decimal` - Current price
- `variants[].currency` - Price currency
- `variants[].in_stock` - Availability status
- `variants[].sku` - SKU for matching
- `variants[].weight_g` - Weight for validation

**Fields to Skip (Performance Optimization):**
- Product descriptions and metadata
- Image URLs and processing
- LLM enrichment data
- Full product specifications
- Detailed variant attributes

### Job Type Configuration
[Source: architecture/2-component-architecture.md#2.1]

**Scheduler Integration:**
- **Full Refresh**: `0 3 1 * *` (monthly at 03:00 UTC on 1st)
- **Price-Only**: `0 4 * * 0` (weekly Sunday at 04:00 UTC)
- **Job Type Flag**: `job_type: "price_only"` vs `job_type: "full_refresh"`

**Configuration Schema:**
```python
class FetcherConfig:
    job_type: Literal["full_refresh", "price_only"]
    roaster_id: str
    concurrency_limit: int = 3
    timeout_seconds: int = 30
    price_only_fields: List[str] = ["price", "availability", "sku"]
```

### Price Delta Detection Logic
[Source: architecture/1-core-data-flow.md#1.2]

**Comparison Strategy:**
1. **Fetch Current Prices**: Get existing `variants.price_current` from database
2. **Parse New Prices**: Extract `price_decimal` from fetched data
3. **Compare Values**: Detect changes in price, currency, or availability
4. **Generate Deltas**: Create list of variants with price changes
5. **Prepare Updates**: Queue price updates for changed variants only

**Delta Detection Algorithm:**
```python
def detect_price_deltas(existing_variants: List[Variant], fetched_variants: List[Variant]) -> List[PriceDelta]:
    deltas = []
    for fetched in fetched_variants:
        existing = find_existing_variant(existing_variants, fetched.platform_variant_id)
        if existing and (existing.price_current != fetched.price_decimal or 
                       existing.currency != fetched.currency or
                       existing.in_stock != fetched.in_stock):
            deltas.append(PriceDelta(
                variant_id=existing.id,
                old_price=existing.price_current,
                new_price=fetched.price_decimal,
                currency=fetched.currency,
                in_stock=fetched.in_stock
            ))
    return deltas
```

### Missing Endpoint Handling
[Source: Epic B requirements]

**Fallback Strategy:**
1. **Check Endpoint Availability**: Test if list endpoint exists and responds
2. **Product Handle Lookup**: Query database for existing product handles
3. **Per-Product Fetching**: Fetch individual products by handle
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with available products only

**Endpoint Detection:**
```python
async def check_endpoint_availability(roaster_config: RoasterConfig) -> bool:
    try:
        response = await httpx.get(roaster_config.list_endpoint, timeout=10)
        return response.status_code == 200
    except Exception:
        return False
```

### Performance Optimization
[Source: architecture/2-component-architecture.md#2.3]

**Speed Improvements:**
- **Reduced Payload**: Skip images, descriptions, and metadata
- **Faster Parsing**: Minimal field extraction
- **Concurrent Processing**: Use existing semaphore limits
- **Caching**: Leverage ETag/Last-Modified for unchanged data
- **Early Exit**: Stop processing if no price changes detected

**Expected Performance:**
- **Full Refresh**: ~5-10 minutes per roaster
- **Price-Only**: ~30-60 seconds per roaster
- **Bandwidth Reduction**: ~80% less data transfer
- **Processing Time**: ~90% faster than full refresh

### Integration Points
- **A.1 Worker**: Extends existing worker with price-only job type
- **A.2 Fetcher**: Extends existing fetcher service with price-only mode
- **A.3 Validation**: Uses lightweight validation for price-only artifacts
- **A.4 RPC**: Extends existing RPC integration with price update calls
- **A.5 Storage**: Uses existing storage system for price data persistence
- **B.2 Price Updates**: Prepares data for B.2 price update integration

### File Locations
Based on the A.1-A.5 completed structure, the price-only fetcher should be structured as:
- Price-only fetcher service: `src/fetcher/price_fetcher.py` (new)
- Job type configuration: `src/config/fetcher_config.py` (extend existing)
- Price parser: `src/fetcher/price_parser.py` (new)
- Integration methods: Extend existing `src/fetcher/fetcher_service.py` ✅ **EXISTS**
- Storage methods: Extend existing `src/fetcher/storage.py` ✅ **EXISTS**
- Tests: `tests/fetcher/test_price_fetcher.py`, `tests/fetcher/test_price_parser.py`

### A.2 Fetcher Integration Strategy
[Source: A.2 completed fetcher infrastructure]

**Leverage Existing A.2 Patterns:**
- ✅ **`FetcherService`**: Extend with `job_type` parameter for price-only mode
- ✅ **`BaseFetcher`**: Extend with price-only field filtering
- ✅ **`ShopifyFetcher`**: Extend with price-only product fetching
- ✅ **`WooCommerceFetcher`**: Extend with price-only product fetching
- ✅ **`ResponseStorage`**: Extend with price-only data storage
- ✅ **HTTP Client**: Reuse existing httpx client, concurrency, and caching
- ✅ **Configuration**: Extend existing FetcherConfig with job type settings

**Integration Approach:**
```python
# Extend existing FetcherService
class FetcherService:
    async def fetch_from_source(
        self,
        source_id: str,
        job_type: str = "full_refresh",  # NEW: Add job type parameter
        auth_credentials: Optional[Dict[str, str]] = None,
        fetch_all: bool = True,
        **fetch_params
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Existing A.2 logic + job_type handling
```

**Platform-Specific Extensions:**
```python
# Extend existing ShopifyFetcher
class ShopifyFetcher(BaseFetcher):
    async def fetch_products(self, limit: int = 50, page: int = 1, **kwargs):
        if self.job_type == "price_only":
            return await self._fetch_price_only_products(limit, page, **kwargs)
        else:
            return await self._fetch_full_products(limit, page, **kwargs)
```

### Technical Constraints
- Use existing httpx client and concurrency controls
- Maintain compatibility with existing fetcher infrastructure
- Support graceful degradation for missing endpoints
- Ensure price data integrity and accuracy
- Handle currency conversion and normalization
- Support existing roaster configuration system

### Testing Requirements
[Source: architecture/8-development-testing.md#8.1]

**Integration Testing:**
- Test price-only mode with sample roasters
- Verify price delta detection accuracy
- Test missing endpoint fallback behavior
- Verify performance improvements over full refresh
- Test with real price data from multiple roasters

**Test Scenarios:**
- Valid price-only fetch with price changes detected
- Missing list endpoint with fallback to per-product fetching
- No price changes (early exit optimization)
- Currency normalization and price formatting
- Performance comparison with full refresh mode
