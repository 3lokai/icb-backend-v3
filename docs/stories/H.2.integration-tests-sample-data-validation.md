# Story H.2: Integration tests: sample data validation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** comprehensive test infrastructure and performance validation for sample data processing,
**so that** I can ensure the system handles large datasets efficiently and recovers gracefully from errors before production deployment.

## Business Context
This story focuses on test infrastructure, performance validation, and error handling for sample data processing. It builds upon existing integration tests by adding orchestration, monitoring, and comprehensive performance testing with large datasets. This ensures the system can handle production-scale data processing reliably.

## Dependencies
**✅ COMPLETED: Foundation available:**
- **Sample data**: `data/samples/shopify/` and `data/samples/woocommerce/` datasets
- **Existing integration tests**: A.1-A.5 pipeline, fetcher, parser, and validator tests
- **Database integration**: RPC upsert functions and Supabase integration
- **Image processing**: F.1-F.3 image handling and ImageKit integration
- **Performance benchmarks**: Existing performance test infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Test orchestration framework manages sample data processing across all existing integration tests
2. Performance validation confirms system handles large datasets within specified limits
3. Error handling tests validate graceful recovery from malformed or incomplete sample data
4. Test monitoring and alerting system provides real-time feedback during test execution
5. Test execution runbook documents operational procedures for sample data testing
6. Memory usage monitoring validates peak memory consumption under 1GB with large datasets
7. Processing time validation confirms full sample data processing within 5 minutes
8. Test cleanup procedures ensure database state isolation between test runs
9. Test data encryption and secure handling procedures protect sensitive sample data
10. Performance regression detection identifies when processing times exceed thresholds
