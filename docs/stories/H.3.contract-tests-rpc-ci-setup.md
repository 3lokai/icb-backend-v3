# Story H.3: Contract tests for RPCs & CI setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** comprehensive contract tests for RPC functions and a robust CI pipeline,
**so that** I can ensure database contracts are stable and deployments are automated and reliable.

## Business Context
This story implements contract testing for RPC functions (`rpc_upsert_coffee`, `rpc_insert_price`, `rpc_upsert_image`) and sets up a comprehensive CI pipeline that validates the entire system. This ensures database contracts remain stable and deployments are automated and reliable.

## Dependencies
**âœ… COMPLETED: RPC infrastructure exists:**
- **RPC Functions**: `rpc_upsert_coffee`, `rpc_insert_price`, `rpc_upsert_image` implemented
- **Database Schema**: Supabase tables and relationships defined
- **Test Infrastructure**: 1,384 tests with comprehensive coverage
- **Sample Data**: Real Shopify and WooCommerce data available
- **Monitoring**: G.1-G.4 observability and alerting infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Contract tests validate RPC schema and database constraints
2. Contract tests validate RPC parameter types and required fields
3. Contract tests validate RPC error handling and edge cases
4. Contract tests validate RPC performance and timeout handling
5. CI pipeline runs all tests automatically on code changes
6. CI pipeline validates database migrations and schema changes
7. CI pipeline validates sample data processing end-to-end
8. CI pipeline provides test coverage reports and quality metrics
9. CI pipeline handles test failures gracefully with clear error reporting
10. CI pipeline supports both unit tests and integration tests

- **Integration Tests**: Complete execution within 5 minutes
- **Contract Tests**: Complete execution within 3 minutes
