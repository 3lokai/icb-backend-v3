# Story H.3: Contract tests for RPCs & CI setup

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** comprehensive contract tests for RPC functions and a robust CI pipeline,
**so that** I can ensure database contracts are stable and deployments are automated and reliable.

## Business Context
This story implements contract testing for RPC functions (`rpc_upsert_coffee`, `rpc_insert_price`, `rpc_upsert_image`) and sets up a comprehensive CI pipeline that validates the entire system. This ensures database contracts remain stable and deployments are automated and reliable.

## Dependencies
**âœ… COMPLETED: RPC infrastructure exists:**
- **RPC Functions**: `rpc_upsert_coffee`, `rpc_insert_price`, `rpc_upsert_image` implemented
- **Database Schema**: Supabase tables and relationships defined
- **Test Infrastructure**: 1,384 tests with comprehensive coverage
- **Sample Data**: Real Shopify and WooCommerce data available
- **Monitoring**: G.1-G.4 observability and alerting infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Contract tests validate RPC schema and database constraints
2. Contract tests validate RPC parameter types and required fields
3. Contract tests validate RPC error handling and edge cases
4. Contract tests validate RPC performance and timeout handling
5. CI pipeline runs all tests automatically on code changes
6. CI pipeline validates database migrations and schema changes
7. CI pipeline validates sample data processing end-to-end
8. CI pipeline provides test coverage reports and quality metrics
9. CI pipeline handles test failures gracefully with clear error reporting
10. CI pipeline supports both unit tests and integration tests

## Dev Notes

### RPC Contract Analysis
[Source: docs/db/rpc.md and existing RPC implementation]

**RPC Functions to Test:**
- **rpc_upsert_coffee**: Coffee product upsert with all parameters
- **rpc_insert_price**: Price insertion with currency and timestamp
- **rpc_upsert_image**: Image upsert with ImageKit URL and metadata

**RPC Parameters to Validate:**
- **Coffee Parameters**: Name, description, roaster, origin, processing
- **Price Parameters**: Amount, currency, timestamp, variant_id
- **Image Parameters**: URL, ImageKit URL, metadata, product_id

### Database Schema Contracts
[Source: docs/db/tables.md]

**Tables to Validate:**
- **coffees**: Product information, metadata, timestamps
- **variants**: Product variants, weights, prices, attributes
- **prices**: Price history, currency, timestamps
- **images**: Image URLs, ImageKit URLs, metadata
- **processing_status**: Status flags, timestamps, error information

### CI Pipeline Architecture
[Source: architecture/4-deployment-architecture-flyio.md]

**CI Pipeline Stages:**
1. **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, complexity checks
2. **Unit Tests**: Parser, normalizer, validator modules
3. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pipeline validation
4. **Contract Tests**: RPC function validation
5. **Performance Tests**: Memory, speed, efficiency
6. **Sample Data Tests**: Real data processing validation
7. **Database Tests**: Schema, migrations, constraints
8. **Deployment Tests**: Production readiness validation

### Test Coverage Requirements
- **Parser Modules**: 90%+ coverage for weight, roast, process, species, sensory
- **Normalizer Modules**: 90%+ coverage for tag normalization, text normalization
- **RPC Functions**: 95%+ coverage for all RPC contract tests
- **Integration Tests**: 85%+ coverage for end-to-end pipeline
- **Sample Data Tests**: 100% coverage for critical data processing paths

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Unit Tests**: Complete execution within 2 minutes
- **Integration Tests**: Complete execution within 5 minutes
- **Contract Tests**: Complete execution within 3 minutes
- **Sample Data Tests**: Complete execution within 10 minutes
- **Total CI Pipeline**: Complete execution within 15 minutes

### Error Handling and Reporting
- **Test Failures**: Clear error messages and stack traces
- **Coverage Reports**: HTML and text coverage reports
- **Quality Metrics**: Code complexity, maintainability scores
- **Performance Reports**: Memory usage, execution time metrics
- **Database Reports**: Schema validation, migration status

## Testing

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run contract tests
python -m pytest tests/contract/ -v

# Run CI pipeline locally
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html --cov-report=term

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v
python -m pytest tests/contract/ -v
