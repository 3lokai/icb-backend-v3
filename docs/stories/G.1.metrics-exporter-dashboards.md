# Story G.1: Metrics exporter & dashboards

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** system administrator,
**I want** comprehensive metrics collection and monitoring dashboards for the coffee scraper pipeline,

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/2-component-architecture.md#2.2]

**Monitoring & Observability Pipeline:**
1. **Metrics Collection** → Pipeline operations, database queries, and system performance
2. **Prometheus Export** → HTTP endpoint for metrics scraping and external monitoring
3. **Grafana Dashboards** → Real-time visualization and historical analysis
4. **Alerting Integration** → Threshold monitoring and notification dispatch

### Existing Infrastructure Foundation
[Source: B.1, B.2, B.3 completed infrastructure]

**B.3 Monitoring Ready:**
- ✅ **PriceJobMetrics**: Prometheus metrics collection and export
- ✅ **RateLimitBackoff**: Database performance monitoring
- ✅ **PriceAlertService**: Alerting system with Slack integration
- ✅ **SentryIntegration**: Error tracking and performance monitoring
- ✅ **Prometheus Export**: HTTP server on port 8000

**A.1-A.5 Pipeline Ready:**
- ✅ **FetcherService**: HTTP client with performance tracking
- ✅ **ValidatorIntegrationService**: Artifact validation with metrics
- ✅ **DatabaseIntegration**: RPC operations with transaction monitoring
- ✅ **RawArtifactPersistence**: Storage operations with audit trails

### Database Schema Integration
[Source: docs/db/tables.md]

**Core Tables for Metrics:**
- **scrape_runs**: Run status, duration, and statistics
- **scrape_artifacts**: Artifact counts, HTTP status, and data quality
- **prices**: Price history and delta tracking
- **variants**: Stock status and price updates
- **coffees**: Product metadata and processing status
- **roasters**: Configuration and performance settings

**Key Metrics to Extract:**
```sql
-- Run performance metrics
SELECT 
    status,
    COUNT(*) as run_count,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (finished_at - started_at))) as avg_duration
FROM scrape_runs 
GROUP BY status;

-- Artifact quality metrics
SELECT 
    http_status,
    COUNT(*) as artifact_count,
    AVG(body_len) as avg_body_size
FROM scrape_artifacts 
GROUP BY http_status;

-- Price delta metrics
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as price_changes,
    AVG(price) as avg_price,
    COUNT(DISTINCT variant_id) as variants_updated
FROM prices 
WHERE scraped_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

### Metrics Collection Strategy
[Source: B.3 completed monitoring infrastructure]

**Extend Existing PriceJobMetrics:**
```python
# Extend existing B.3 metrics with pipeline-wide collection
class PipelineMetrics(PriceJobMetrics):
    def __init__(self, prometheus_port: int = 8000):
        super().__init__(prometheus_port)
        # Add pipeline-specific metrics
        self.fetch_latency = Histogram('fetch_latency_seconds', 'Fetch operation duration')
        self.artifact_count = Counter('artifacts_total', 'Total artifacts processed')
        self.review_rate = Gauge('review_rate_percent', 'Review rate percentage')
        self.database_queries = Counter('database_queries_total', 'Database queries executed')
    
    def record_fetch_operation(self, duration: float, source: str, status: str):
        """Record fetch operation metrics"""
        self.fetch_latency.observe(duration)
        self.artifact_count.labels(source=source, status=status).inc()
    
    def record_database_metrics(self, query_type: str, duration: float, success: bool):
        """Record database operation metrics"""
        self.database_queries.labels(query_type=query_type, success=success).inc()
```

**Database Metrics Service:**
```python
class DatabaseMetricsService:
    def __init__(self, supabase_client):
        self.supabase = supabase_client
    
    async def collect_scrape_run_metrics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Collect metrics from scrape_runs table"""
        result = await self.supabase.table('scrape_runs').select('*').execute()
        runs = result.data
        
        return {
            "total_runs": len(runs),
            "successful_runs": len([r for r in runs if r['status'] == 'ok']),
            "failed_runs": len([r for r in runs if r['status'] == 'fail']),
            "avg_duration": self._calculate_avg_duration(runs)
        }
    
    async def collect_artifact_metrics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Collect metrics from scrape_artifacts table"""
        result = await self.supabase.table('scrape_artifacts').select('*').execute()
        artifacts = result.data
        
        return {
            "total_artifacts": len(artifacts),
            "http_200_count": len([a for a in artifacts if a['http_status'] == 200]),
            "avg_body_size": sum(a['body_len'] for a in artifacts) / len(artifacts) if artifacts else 0
        }
```
