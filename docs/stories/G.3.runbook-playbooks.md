## Dev Notes

### Self-Hosting vs Free Tier Considerations

**Documentation Platform Options:**
- **GitHub/GitLab**: Free tier (unlimited public repos, private repos with limits)
- **Self-Hosting**: GitLab CE, Gitea, or Forgejo (unlimited private repos, full control)
- **Recommendation**: Use existing GitHub/GitLab for runbook storage (no additional costs)

**Monitoring and Alerting Integration:**
- **Grafana**: Self-hosted (already implemented in G.1) - Web access via Fly.io proxy with auth
- **Prometheus**: Self-hosted (already implemented in G.1) - Internal network only on Fly.io
- **Sentry**: Free tier or self-hosted (leverage G.2 infrastructure)
- **Slack**: Free tier (leverage existing B.3 integration)
- **Fly.io Deployment**: Internal networking for Prometheus, external access for Grafana

**Operational Tools:**
- **Database Monitoring**: Leverage existing G.1 database metrics
- **Alert Management**: Use existing G.2 alerting infrastructure
- **Incident Tracking**: GitHub Issues or self-hosted alternatives
- **Cost**: Minimal additional costs by leveraging existing infrastructure

**Cost Optimization Strategy:**
- Store runbooks in existing repository (no additional storage costs)
- Leverage existing G.1/G.2 monitoring for operational procedures
- Use existing B.3 alerting patterns for incident response
- Implement efficient documentation workflows with existing tools
- **Fly.io Deployment**: Use internal networking for Prometheus, external access for Grafana with authentication
