## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture/4-deployment-architecture-flyio.md#4.1]

**Fly App Structure:**
- **dashboard-web**: New Fly app for operations dashboard (publicly exposed)
- **Integration**: Connects to existing monitoring infrastructure
- **Database**: Direct Supabase connection for real-time data access
- **Metrics**: Leverages existing Prometheus metrics and G.1 infrastructure

### Technology Stack
**Backend:**
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework
- **WebSockets**: Real-time updates using Flask-SocketIO
- **Supabase**: Direct database connection for live data
- **Redis**: Caching and session management (optional)

**Frontend:**
- **HTML5/CSS3**: Modern responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Real-time updates and interactivity
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization and metrics charts
- **Bootstrap/Tailwind**: Responsive UI framework

**Deployment:**
- **Fly.io**: Separate app deployment (`dashboard-web`)
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated deployment

### Database Integration
[Source: docs/db/tables.md]

**⚠️ CRITICAL SCHEMA NOTES:**
- **scrape_runs** has `source_id` (not `roaster_id`) - requires JOIN with product_sources
- **coffees** has `status` (coffee_status_enum) - not `processing_status`
- **confidence scores** are in `sensory_params` table - not in coffees
- **price deltas** not available in database - requires application logic
- **success rates** must be calculated from `stats_json` field

**Key Tables for Dashboard:**
- **scrape_runs**: Run status, duration, and statistics (via stats_json)
- **scrape_artifacts**: Artifact counts, HTTP status, and data quality
- **coffees**: Product metadata and status (coffee_status_enum)
- **variants**: Stock status and current prices
- **prices**: Price history (no delta calculations available)
- **roasters**: Configuration and performance settings
- **sensory_params**: Confidence scores and sensory analysis data
- **product_sources**: Links roasters to scrape runs

**Dashboard Queries:**
```sql
-- Current pipeline status (CORRECTED for actual schema)
SELECT 
    sr.id,
    sr.started_at,
    sr.finished_at,
    sr.status,
    ps.roaster_id,
    sr.stats_json
FROM scrape_runs sr
JOIN product_sources ps ON sr.source_id = ps.id
WHERE sr.started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY sr.started_at DESC;

-- Data quality metrics (CORRECTED for actual schema)
SELECT 
    c.status,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    AVG(sp.confidence) as avg_confidence
FROM coffees c
LEFT JOIN sensory_params sp ON c.id = sp.coffee_id
WHERE c.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY c.status;

-- Price tracking (CORRECTED - no price_delta_pct available)
SELECT 
    DATE(p.scraped_at) as date,
    COUNT(*) as price_updates,
    AVG(p.price) as avg_price
FROM prices p
WHERE p.scraped_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY DATE(p.scraped_at)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Roaster performance metrics
SELECT 
    r.id,
    r.name,
    COUNT(sr.id) as total_runs,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN sr.status = 'ok' THEN 1 END) as successful_runs,
    AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (sr.finished_at - sr.started_at))) as avg_duration_seconds
FROM roasters r
LEFT JOIN product_sources ps ON r.id = ps.roaster_id
LEFT JOIN scrape_runs sr ON ps.id = sr.source_id
WHERE sr.started_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY r.id, r.name;
```

### Real-time Updates Strategy
**WebSocket Events:**
- **pipeline_status**: Current run status and progress
- **job_queue**: Queue updates and job completion
- **metrics_update**: Business metrics and data quality
- **alert_notification**: Critical alerts and warnings

**Update Frequency:**
- **Pipeline Status**: Every 5 seconds during active runs
- **Business Metrics**: Every 30 seconds for dashboard updates
- **Alerts**: Immediate push notifications
- **Historical Data**: Every 5 minutes for trend analysis

### Security and Access Control
**Authentication:**
- **Session-based**: Flask sessions with secure cookies
- **Role-based Access**: Admin, Operator, Viewer roles (User role blocked)
- **Default Role**: "user" role is default for new users but blocked from operations dashboard
- **API Keys**: For programmatic access to dashboard data

**Security Features:**
- **HTTPS Only**: All communication encrypted
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery prevention
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoint protection

## Success Metrics
- Dashboard loads in < 2 seconds with real-time data
- Mobile responsiveness score > 90% on all devices
- Real-time updates with < 1 second latency
- 99.9% uptime for dashboard availability
- User authentication and role-based access working
- Integration with existing G.1 monitoring infrastructure
